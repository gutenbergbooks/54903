<h2 id="c1">EDITOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Some months before the death of my true hearted friend, Rev.
S. W. Duffield, he wrote to express his wish that I should complete
this work, if he did not live to finish it. As I was not aware
how grave, and even hopeless, was his illness, I did not feel that
I was undertaking a serious responsibility in assenting to his wish.
But his untimely death brought to me the duty of discharging a
wish which &ldquo;the emphasis of death&rdquo; made imperative.</p>
<p>In our conferences over the book and its subject, which we had
had for three years past, I had come to appreciate Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s
ideas as to its form and content, and read with much interest his
preliminary studies in the <i>Christian Intelligencer</i>, the <i>Sunday-School
Times</i>, and the <i>New Englander</i>. On coming into possession
of his manuscript and notes, I found that the greater part of the
book had been carried almost to the point of readiness for the
printer, although several chapters had not been written and all
needed careful revision.</p>
<p>I have revised throughout the chapters Mr. Duffield left, but in
doing so I have been embarrassed by the very vitality and personal
quality in Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s style. He reminds one of what Archdeacon
Hare says of the freshness and living force in a page of
Luther&rsquo;s. This has constrained me to leave intact many a phrase
or expression I should not have used, but which was natural and
even inevitable in him. It is my hope that I have not sacrificed
this admirable quality of his writing to any pedantry of judgment.</p>
<p>The chapters on Pope Damasus (Chapter IV.) I have rewritten
throughout. That on Bernard of Cluny I have rearranged, but
without much alteration. That on Thomas of Celano I have rewritten
to the top of page 252. That on Hermann of Reichenau
I should have liked to rewrite; but as I dissented from some of
its arguments, I feared to more than retouch it. It stands as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
monument of its author&rsquo;s vehement conviction that in Hermann
he had found the true author of the <i>Veni Sancte Spiritus</i>.</p>
<p>The later chapters, from Thomas Aquinas, with the exception of
those on Jacoponus and Xavier, are the work of the editor alone.
In preparing them I have followed the author&rsquo;s own plan for the
book, except (1) in treating of the less-known as well as the unknown
hymn-writers in Chapters XXX. and XXXI.; (2) in inserting
a chapter on the relations of Protestantism to Latin hymnology;
and (3) in giving in the last chapter only a selection from
Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s great <i>Index of the Latin Hymns</i>, which I hope to see
published complete in a separate book. Translations not credited
to any other person are the work of Mr. Duffield.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s own idea of his book is well expressed in the
<a href="#c2">Introduction</a> which follows this Preface. I give it as he left it,
although he had noted his purpose to prepare another which
would cover the ground more fully. It now remains to say something
of the man personally, and in this I am indebted much to
the assistance of his faithful coworker in his hymnological studies,
Miss Lilian B. Day of Bloomfield, who copied his great <i>Index of
the Latin Hymns</i>, and who prepared the indexes to both his <i>English
Hymns</i> and the present volume.</p>
<hr />
<p>Samuel Augustus Willoughby Duffield was born at Brooklyn,
on September 24th, 1843. His family was of French Huguenot
extraction (Du Field), and found a home in the North of Ireland
after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Between 1725 and
1730 George Duffield, his ancestor by five removes, settled in
Lancaster County, as one of the great Ulster emigration which
was flowing into Pennsylvania. His son George graduated at
Princeton, and after several pastorates was settled in Philadelphia
in the Pine Street church. He was an ardent patriot, chaplain in
Washington&rsquo;s army, and Bishop White&rsquo;s associate in the chaplaincy
of the Continental Congress. Of two sons who survived him, one
became a minister, while the other took a prominent part in public
life. His grandson, Rev. George Duffield, D.D. (1796-1868)
was a leader of the New School division of the Presbyterian
Church, both before and after the separation of 1837, and while
pastor at Carlisle was arraigned for unsound teaching in his work
on <i>Regeneration</i>. &ldquo;Barnes, Beman, and Duffield&rdquo; were the
<span class="pb" id="Page_v">v</span>
three names most offensive to the Aristarchuses of orthodoxy in
that time. He was married to a sister of Dr. George W. Bethune.
His son, generally known in our times as Dr. George
Duffield, Jr., to distinguish him from his father, was born in 1818
at Carlisle, graduated at Yale College in 1837, and at Union
Theological Seminary. One of his pastorates was in Brooklyn,
from 1840 to 1847, during which his son, Samuel Augustus Willoughby,
was born. He is best known as a hymn-writer, two of
his hymns being known and loved wherever the English language
is spoken. They are, &ldquo;Blessed Saviour, Thee I love,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Stand up, stand up for Jesus,&rdquo; the latter being suggested by the
dying words of Dudley Tyng in 1858.</p>
<p>Samuel W. Duffield was of the sixth American generation of his
family. From his youth he was a young giant, with an inborn
love of active sports, quick in movement, and apparently incapable
of fatigue. His mind showed equal vigor and freshness, and he early
developed a passion for poetry. By his tenth year he had mastered
Chaucer, in spite of difficulties much more serious to beginners
in those days than in our own. And he very early began to find
expression for his own ideas in verse. He united with the Church
at the age of thirteen, when his father was a pastor in Philadelphia,
being the only one who did so at the time, so that the act was the
result of personal decision and not of a revival excitement. He
graduated at Yale in 1863; and after teaching for a while, he
began the study of theology under the care of his grandfather and
his father. Not until after he had been licensed to preach, and
had had charge of a mission in Chicago, did he present himself as
a student in Union Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>His first pastorate was from 1867 to 1870 at Tioga, one of the
northern suburbs of Philadelphia. As he frequently came to the
office of the <i>American Presbyterian</i>, on which I was assisting the
late Dr. John W. Mears, I then formed an acquaintance with him,
which ripened into a friendship that was to be lifelong, and I hope
even longer. He was an impressive figure, of more than the
ordinary height, and yet so massively built that he was seen to be
tall only when beside another person. His manner was cheerful,
affectionate and buoyant, giving evidence in various ways of his
French descent. His character was winning and attractive by its
openness, and its entire freedom from selfishness. He was a man
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
out of whose heart the child never died, and he carried the freshness
of his boyhood&rsquo;s years into the mature pursuits of his manhood.</p>
<p>Our common love of poetry and our dawning interest in Latin
hymnology&mdash;he had translated Bernard of Cluny and was trying
his hand on the <i>Dies Irae</i> in those days&mdash;drew us closer together
and gave our friendship an intellectual interest. When he left
Tioga for Jersey City our intercourse became more fragmentary,
but during his pastorate at Ann Arbor (1871-74) it was renewed
by correspondence. He felt himself especially at home in the
university city of Michigan, with a congregation composed largely
of the students. Here he had the delight of welcoming Dr.
George Macdonald to his pulpit, when the poet visited America in
1873. He worked hard to have me called to the Chair of English
Literature in the University of Michigan, but did not succeed.</p>
<p>Chicago, 1874, Auburn, 1876, Altoona, 1878, and Bloomfield,
1882, were his subsequent pastorates; and in Bloomfield he remained
until his death. In this New Jersey suburb of New York
City he seemed to find himself especially at home. It was indeed
the home of his early boyhood, for his father had been pastor of
the same church from 1847 to 1852; he well remembered his
playmates and schoolmates, and kept up his acquaintance by correspondence
and visits, until he came among them as their pastor.
He was near enough to the great city to find easy access to its
libraries, especially the Astor Library and that of Union Seminary,
and to enjoy the friendship of scholars of tastes similar to his own,
especially that of Dr. Charles S. Robinson. He found a congenial
people in his congregation. He took a lively interest in
matters relating to the welfare of the town, was an active member
of the Village Improvement Association, labored hard to establish
a public library, and helped to set on foot a good weekly paper.
He became Chaplain of the Fire Company, and preached a special
sermon every year to its members. He spoke always with enthusiasm
of his new environment, and seemed to look forward to
many happy and useful years there. His home life, I shall only
say, was especially happy and helpful to him. Among his delights
was to watch the dawning powers of a daughter, who inherits
all her father&rsquo;s poetic gifts.</p>
<p>His best poetical work is still unpublished, except such parts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
it as have appeared in the <i>Sunday-School Times</i> and other weeklies.
His first venture was <i>The Heavenly Land, from the Rhythm of Bernard
of Morlaix</i> (New York, 1867). His second and most characteristic
book was <i>Warp and Woof: A Book of Verse</i> (1868), in
which &ldquo;Undergraduate Orioles&rdquo; and some other pieces at once
attracted attention by their felicitous beauty and genuineness.
Along with his father, he prepared <i>The Burial of the Dead</i> (1882),
a manual for use at funerals. In the long interval between these
two dates he was already laboring at his book on the Latin hymn-writers.
&ldquo;During the years 1882-85,&rdquo; writes Miss Day, &ldquo;those
of us who saw him most frequently on his way to and from the
New York libraries came to recognize a large, square note-book
and a green cloth bag as his inseparable Monday companions.
Something of their contents we knew, for with his genial disposition
he could not refrain from quoting snatches of the old Latin
hymns with translations into musical English. But no one could
appreciate the real worth of the knowledge concealed between
cloth and board as did the student himself, who had spent the
hours of leisure snatched from professional labors in the libraries,
and among Latin quartos and folios, in search of the materials for
his book. During the latter part of 1885 the Latin hymn-writers
were laid aside for a while to give time for his work on <i>English
Hymns: Their Authors and History</i> (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls,
1886),&rdquo; which was suggested by the appearance of Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s
<i>Laudes Domini</i> in 1884, and is mainly an account of the
hymns included in that work, and of their authors. When this
was finished he returned to his <i>opus magnum</i>, in the expectation of
having it soon ready for the press. From our conferences and
correspondence I was led to hope for its early appearance. But
this was not to be. A failure of the vessels of the heart, evidently
from some constitutional weakness, as he had been making no
special exertion when it showed itself, was the beginning of the
end. Twelve weary months of illness, spent partly in Bloomfield
and partly at a watering-place, to which he had gone for change of
air, were followed by his death on May 12th, 1887. He died as
he had lived, in the full assurance of the Gospel, and looking for
life everlasting in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The news of his death was received with grief by the whole community,
especially by the young people, with whom he had so
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
lively a sympathy. The Bloomfield Fire Company displayed their
flag at half-mast, placed a guard of honor over his remains during
the forty hours they lay at the church, and attended his funeral in
a body. Signs of the general mourning were seen everywhere,
and the town felt it had lost a public-spirited citizen, while his
church had lost a faithful and devoted pastor. Mingled with
memoranda for his book, I find in his note-books other indications
of the breadth and energy of his work for the spiritual and
intellectual improvement of his people, especially through his lectures
before the Young People&rsquo;s Society of the Westminster Church.</p>
<p>In the city of the dead at Detroit, where his kindred lie buried,
there stands a memorial stone, which bears the inscription:</p>
<p class="center">DILECTISSIMUS
<br />EHEU PRAEMISSUS EST
<br />QUANQUAM E VITAE INTEGRAE MEDIO

<br />BEATO ILLI
<br />PATER UXOR
<br />MULTIS CUM LACRIMIS
<br />HOC MARMOR
<br />DEDICAVERE</p>
<p>Beside him lies now the mortal part of the much-loved father
who wrote these words. Dr. George Duffield the younger died
July 6, 1888.</p>

<h2 id="c2">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>The study of the Latin hymns is so much a thing of its own
kind that one owes it to himself as well as to his readers to begin
at the beginning. This beginning in the present instance happened
to be on the North River, on a bright, fresh April morning
in the year of grace 1882. It was at that time, with the clear sky
overhead and the hearty breeze coming full in our faces from the
Narrows, that my friend, the Rev. F. N. Zabriskie, D.D., broached
the following proposition:</p>
<p>It was, he said, a matter of great surprise to him that no one
had done for the Latin hymn-writers what had been done for those
of later date. We had their hymns, but for his part he confessed
to a love for the personality of the poets themselves, and for the
circumstances which conspired to produce their poems. Now, if
it seemed good to myself, who had already given time and study
to the hymns, he would gladly open the columns of the <i>Christian
Intelligencer</i> (the organ of the Reformed Church in America) to
a series of articles bearing such a character. And there and then
the book began.</p>
<p>But my original ideas modified greatly as I went on. In place
of my mastering the subject, the subject mastered me. My previous
studies went for but very little, and my confidence in my
ability to prepare the articles without taking much time from
regular and important duties diminished with every number. I
found myself on new ground and was perpetually referred back to
the original authorities. French and German and Latin&mdash;I had
to investigate them all in order to satisfy that insatiate creature, a
scholar&rsquo;s conscience. I discovered that, except for rare and slight
notices, this sort of work had neither been done nor was likely to
be done, and conferences with our best hymnologists only made
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
me more interested in doing it, and doing it as well as I could.
Doubtless those whose specialities lie in mediaeval days will find
much to criticise, but no one can be a severer critic than myself
according to my means of information.</p>
<p>These chapters, like this Introduction, will be found to be written
in the American language. Their purpose is to reach the
popular desire for better knowledge, and it would be absurd to
offer these facts in any dry or pedantic style. Yet the scholar and
the hymnologist will both find that a positive value and a careful
accuracy attach to the work that has been done. I found I
could take nothing for granted, and I took nothing for granted.
Even the Archbishop of Dublin and the principal of Sackville
College have their idiosyncrasies and predilections, and a quite
easy way of writing on these topics is to copy what has been said
already. A very notable case to the contrary is Lord Selborne&rsquo;s
splendid article on &ldquo;Hymns&rdquo; in the new <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore life and song and color are not absent, I trust, from
these pages. I should not like to give all the authorities consulted
or rummaged through; for, indeed, I have kept no record of
them. Like the famous sun-dial I have registered none but the
serene hours, and many a time the scarce and long-sought volume
before me has been jejune enough. While, on the other hand, a
book like Morison&rsquo;s <i>Life of St. Bernard</i> has turned out to be
precisely the help I was seeking, bright in its style and careful
and original in its researches. I have verified its quotations too
often not to pay it at least this faint tribute of approval.</p>
<p>It would be also beyond measure ungrateful in me if I did not
here acknowledge the kindnesses I have received in this quest after
the Sangreal of a true psalmody. Let me name, then, the Astor
Library. Its superintendent, Mr. Little, and its librarians, Mr.
Frederick Saunders (author of <i>Evenings with the Sacred Poets</i>),
and his assistant, Mr. Bierstadt, have been uniformly courteous
and obliging. So has been the Rev. Professor Charles A. Briggs,
D.D., in whose care is the fine theological library of Union Seminary.
So have been the authorities of the Society Library (New
York), and of the Philadelphia Library, and of the Boston Athenaeum
and Public libraries.</p>
<p>Personally, I am deeply indebted to the culture and friendship
of Miss Marion L. Pelton, Assistant Professor of Literature in
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
Wellesley College, who has made for me many valuable notes;
and to the assistance and counsel of Professor F. A. March,
LL.D., Professor F. M. Bird, Professor Philip Schaff, D.D., and
Judge W. H. Arnoux.</p>
<p>It will be readily seen that I have not concerned myself with the
matter of the host of English translations, or with that of the comparison
and criticism of the text of the hymns. These branches
of hymnology are in a scientific sense the most valuable, but in a
popular sense they are the least interesting. And I could not hope
to rival, far less to equal, such illustrious scholarship as that of
Daniel or Mone. I have therefore been content to pipe to a lesser
reed, and in a more familiar and gossiping way to attempt the
history of the hymns. And for the rest I can only add what
Master Robert Burton saith in his <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>: &ldquo;If
through weakness, folly, passion, ignorance, I have said amiss, let
it be forgotten and forgiven.... I earnestly request every private
man, as Scaliger did Cardan, not to take offence.... If thou
knewest my modesty and simplicity, thou wouldest easily pardon
and forgive what is here amiss, or by thee misconceived.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 title="">LATIN HYMNS.</h1>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE PRAISE SERVICE OF THE EARLY CHURCH.</span></h2>
<p>When our Lord and His disciples &ldquo;had sung an hymn&rdquo; they
left the place where they had observed the passover, and went out
to the Mount of Olives. This hymn was the &ldquo;Great Hallel,&rdquo;
consisting of Psalms 113 to 118 inclusive. The 113th and 114th
were sung previous to the feast; the others, after it. We thus
know, with singular accuracy, what was the first hymn of praise in
the Christian Church. The essence of this &ldquo;Hallel&rdquo; is the
essence of all true psalmody&mdash;trust and thanksgiving and praise.</p>
<p>It may be said, and with truth, that the <i>Magnificat</i> of Mary, the
<i>Nunc Dimittis</i> of old Simeon, and, above all, that the <i>Gloria in
Excelsis Deo</i> of the angels at Bethlehem, antedate this hymn of
our Lord and His apostles. It may also be said, and with the
same truth, that these furnished to the early Christians their earliest
expressions of praise. But it appears that the Last Supper,
with its pathetic union of Jewish and Christian ideas, was also the
place at which the Psalms of David and the spiritual songs of
primitive Christianity were united. The thought that this reveals
is larger than these limits will permit us to discuss. It is in brief
that as Jesus Christ came, &ldquo;not to destroy, but to fulfil,&rdquo; He
designed to show to His Church that gratitude, love, trust, and
adoration were to be combined in all future psalmody. The
<i>t&rsquo;hillim</i> of the Jew were to become the <i>hymni</i> of the Christian.</p>
<p>The noticeable fact remains that the early Church only caught
the simplest and most fervent forms of this worship. Their pure
veneration of the Lord led Pliny to write (Ep. 10:97) that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
&ldquo;sung alternately among themselves a hymn to Christ as God&rdquo;&mdash;<i>carmen
Christo quasi Deo, dicere secum invicem</i>. It is this loving
devotion which charms us as we read those verses which have been
preserved. For the most part the subjects are limited. We could
naturally expect that, being largely drawn from Jewish sources,
they would express gratitude and adoration&mdash;and this is correct.
Chrysostom declared that the early Christians sung at prayers in
the morning, at their work, and very usually at their meals.
Jerome, writing to Marcellus, says&mdash;and we quote Cave&rsquo;s translation
for its quaintness&mdash;&ldquo;You could not go into the field but
you might hear the <i>Ploughman</i> at his <i>Hallelujahs</i>, the <i>Mower</i> at his
<i>Hymns</i>, and the <i>Vine-dresser</i> singing <i>David&rsquo;s Psalms</i>.&rdquo; In fact,
Christian song was a notable feature of primitive Christianity.</p>
<p>The language of these hymns was either Syriac or Greek. By
degrees the Greek obtained the precedence; and as the Latin hymns
did not arise until Hilary of Poitiers (fourth century), the period
between the Ascension and that era belongs to the Greek language
rather more than to any other. We also know from the New
Testament writers some very important facts, which may properly
be classified at this point.</p>
<p>1. There were three terms for the sacred song. It might be a
<i>psalm</i>, or a <i>hymn</i>, or a <i>spiritual song</i>, as we
discover from <span class="scripRef">Ephesians 5:19</span> and <span class="scripRef">Colossians 3:16</span>.</p>
<p>2. From <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 14:23-33</span>, it seems plain that the composition,
as well as the singing of these hymns and songs, might be
the result of sudden emotion or inspiration. In any case, there is
no doubt (for Tertullian decisively states it) that the &ldquo;extempore,&rdquo;
or, more strictly, &ldquo;private&rdquo; authorship of such psalmody was not
uncommon. The council of Laodicea (<i>circa</i> <span class="small">A.D.</span> 360) interdicted
private persons from this privilege. Even in Paul&rsquo;s time it
would appear to have produced an effect akin to the &ldquo;spirituals&rdquo;
of our own freedmen&mdash;much of it being exquisite in its simple
devotion, while a certain share offended good taste, and hindered
the propriety and solemnity of worship.</p>
<p>3. The alternation of prayer with praise was never better illustrated
than when Paul and Silas (<span class="scripRef">Acts 16:25</span>) sent up their midnight
anthems from that &ldquo;inner prison,&rdquo; while their feet were
&ldquo;made fast in the stocks.&rdquo; This alternation was&mdash;as the Fathers
assure us&mdash;the order in public worship also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>4. We have received in the very pages of the New Testament
some of these earliest hymns. To say nothing, at present, of
those great leading chants which bear the names of the angels,
and of Mary, and of Zacharias, and of Simeon&mdash;and to pass over
all those of Jewish origin&mdash;we have still left us such a strain as
that in <span class="scripRef">Acts 4:24-30</span>. Here we have an impulse which expresses
itself in reply to Peter and John by sacred song.</p>
<p><span class="scripRef">Ephesians 5:14</span> has also been considered to be such a fragment:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Awake, O thou that sleepest!</p>
<p class="t0">Arouse thee from the dead!</p>
<p class="t0">And Christ shall give to thee</p>
<p class="t0">Enlightenment!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So too <span class="scripRef">1 Timothy 3:16</span> has been arranged by some scholars as
though it were a well-known strophe the Apostle quoted:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Who&mdash;for the mystery is great&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Was manifest in body,</p>
<p class="t0">Was justified in spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">Was visible to angels,</p>
<p class="t0">Was heralded to heathen,</p>
<p class="t0">Was trusted on the earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Was taken up to glory.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nor is this the only instance in this very Epistle, for <span class="scripRef">1 Timothy 6:15, 16</span>, reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The king of all the kingly ones,</p>
<p class="t0">The lord of all the lordly ones,</p>
<p class="t0">Who only hath the power of life immortal;</p>
<p class="t0">Inhabiting the unapproachable light;</p>
<p class="t0">Whom never any one of men hath seen,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor ever can behold;</p>
<p class="t0">Let glory and eternal strength be his!</p>
<p class="t10">Amen!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>5. When, now, we complete our New Testament mention of
this praise&mdash;which clings like incense to the temple-curtains and
sweetly perfumes the place&mdash;we have only to add the earliest received
anthems. These are the <i>Magnificat</i> (<span class="scripRef">Luke 1:46-55</span>); the
<i>Benedictus</i> (<span class="scripRef">Luke 1:68-79</span>); the <i>Gloria in Excelsis Deo</i>
(<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:18</span>); and the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>
(<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:29-32</span>). It will be observed
that all these are derived from a single gospel, wherein,
more than in any other, the &ldquo;sweet, sad music of humanity&rdquo; can
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
most readily be found. It is natural, too, that the painter and
physician, Luke, should have a poetic ear which could catch&mdash;as
in the Acts of the Apostles&mdash;this faintest and earliest praise. There
were, indeed, in the primitive church, eight of these classic expressions
of worship. These are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>(1) The Lesser Doxology (<i>Gloria Patri</i>),</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>(2) The Greater Doxology (<i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>),</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace,&rdquo; etc.</dd>
<dd class="small">[This was also called the Angelical Hymn.]</dd>
<dt>(3) The <i>Ter Sanctus</i> (the cherubical hymn),</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>(4) The Hallelujah.</dt>
<dd class="small">[This &ldquo;Alleluia, Amen!&rdquo; was the response of the church.]</dd>
<dt>(5) The Evening Hymn (containing the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>).</dt>
<dt>(6) The <i>Benedicite</i>.</dt>
<dd class="small">[The &ldquo;Song of the Three Children,&rdquo; which is taken from the Apocrypha, and which appears
in the service of the Episcopal Church (Order for Morning Prayer) as, &ldquo;O all ye
works of the Lord,&rdquo; etc.]</dd>
<dt>(7) The <i>Magnificat</i>.</dt>
<dd class="small">[Named&mdash;as these are all named&mdash;from the first word of the Latin Vulgate version.]</dd>
<dt>(8) The <i>Te Deum</i>,</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;We praise Thee, O God, we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord,&rdquo; etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We can feel quite sure that the Latin Church merely borrowed
these hymns from the earliest forms of the Greek. The <i>Te Deum</i>
was probably translated from that language, either by Hilary of
Poitiers or by an unknown author of that date. It is, undoubtedly,
a close rendering of many phrases and expressions
which are common to the Greek hymns, and, if the learned
hymnologist H. A. Daniel is to be credited (<i>Thesaurus Hymnologicus
II.</i> 289), it is a real and literal translation of an actual
chant of praise of great antiquity. His words are these: &ldquo;To
give you my opinion briefly, the <i>Te Deum</i>, equally with the
Angelic Hymn (to which it is very similar in form and expression),
was born in the Eastern Church, whence it has been translated
into the Latin tongue.&rdquo; He then proceeds to cite an
ancient Greek hymn, five lines of which are exact with the Latin.</p>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">2 Timothy 2:11-13</span> the &ldquo;faithful saying&rdquo; has been interpreted
to be a similar quotation from one of these ancient hymns:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For if we are dead together,</p>
<p class="t0">We shall live together;</p>
<p class="t0">If we serve together,</p>
<p class="t0">We shall reign together;</p>
<p class="t0">If we should deny Him,</p>
<p class="t0">He will deny us too;</p>
<p class="t0">If we should be faithless,</p>
<p class="t0">He is faithful still.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It does not, of course, absolutely follow that these are really such
fragments of hymns as scholars have supposed. The late Dr.
Lyman Coleman&mdash;a man of great practical good judgment&mdash;comments
upon these citations thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The argument is not conclusive; and all the learned criticism,
the talent, and the taste, that have been employed on this
point, leave us little else than uncertain conjecture on which to
build an hypothesis.&rdquo; (<i>Primitive Church</i>, p. 366.) Yet the
latest scholarship tends so strongly in this direction, and the internal
evidence is so good and fair, that it may be regarded as
pretty well affirmed and accepted. No one, for example, would
think of comparing such passages as these with the antithetic prose
of <span class="scripRef">Romans 3:21-23</span>; or with the magnificent unrhythmic utterance
in <span class="scripRef">Romans 8:38, 39</span>; or with the careful particularity of
<span class="scripRef">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</span>. They are seen and felt to be different
both in tone and in form.</p>
<p>In the Apocalypse, where the language is naturally exalted and
poetic, several such instances have been noted. They are: <span class="scripRef">Revelation 1:4-8</span>;
<span class="scripRef">5:9, 10, 12-14</span>; <span class="scripRef">11:15, 17, 18</span>; <span class="scripRef">15:3, 4</span>;
<span class="scripRef">21:10-14</span>, and <span class="scripRef">22:17</span>. Of one of these&mdash;the &ldquo;Song of Moses
and of the Lamb&rdquo;&mdash;we may be reasonably certain:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Great are Thy works and strange,</p>
<p class="t0">Lord God, Thou Ruler of all!</p>
<p class="t0">And just are Thy ways, and true,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou King of the nations of earth.</p>
<p class="t0">For who shall not fear Thee, Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">And give to Thy name the praise,</p>
<p class="t0">For holy art Thou alone!&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee shall the nations come</p>
<p class="t0">And worship before Thy face;</p>
<p class="t0">For all of Thy righteous acts</p>
<p class="t0">Shall then be openly known!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>In the same manner may be written the stanza from <span class="scripRef">Revelation 22:17</span>:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And the Spirit and the Bride&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Are saying, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And he that heareth&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Let him say, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And he that thirsteth&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Let him come!</p>
<p class="t0">And he that willeth&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Let him receive,</p>
<p class="t0">Freely, the water of life!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have also a positive acquaintance with the order of religious
worship in the early Church, dating back one hardly knows how
far, but definitely leading us into the custom of the first three
centuries. Public services began, and were continued, as follows:</p>
<p>First, <i>Prayer</i>&mdash;or, possibly, a <i>Salutation</i> or <i>Invocation</i>, such as
is in common use to-day.</p>
<p>Then the <i>Reading of Scripture</i>. The Old Testament and New
Testament were both employed: the one being expounded to
apply to the case of the Christian Church; and the other for her
comfort, encouragement, and edification.</p>
<p>Then followed the <i>Hymns</i> and <i>Psalms</i>. The distinction appears
to have been that the <i>psalms</i> were those of David; the <i>hymns</i>, such
as the song of Mary, or of the angels; and the <i>spiritual songs</i>,
such as were composed by private persons, or which sprang up
spontaneously in a kind of chant. That this was liable to
abuse, and might cause confusion, is made evident by Paul&rsquo;s
advice to the Corinthians. Between these acts of praise was
interpolated some brief Scripture lesson. And, very likely, a
considerable portion of time was taken up by this part of the
service.</p>
<p>Then came the <i>Sermon</i>, which was succeeded by a <i>Prayer</i>.</p>
<p>Another question now meets us, and one of some importance:
Did the early Christians employ any musical instruments? In
reply, it can be noted that &psi;&#8049;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;,
&ldquo;to make melody&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Eph.5:19</span>), is usually taken to refer to a musical accompaniment.
In <span class="scripRef">Romans 15:9</span> it is a quotation from <span class="scripRef">Psalm 18:50</span>, where it
means, &ldquo;I will <i>sing psalms</i>.&rdquo; In <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 15:15</span> (&ldquo;I will
<i>sing</i> with the spirit, and I will <i>sing</i> with the understanding also&rdquo;)
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and in <span class="scripRef">James 5:13</span> (&ldquo;Is any merry? let him <i>sing psalms</i>&rdquo;) we
have nothing decisive except that we know that the Jewish method
of &ldquo;singing psalms&rdquo; was to the accompaniment of musical instruments.
Thus, with all these texts before us, we are not able either
to affirm or deny the fact. The reference of Paul (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 14:7</span>)
to the <i>pipe</i> (&alpha;&upsilon;&lambda;&#8057;&sigmaf;, flute) and <i>harp</i>
(&kappa;&iota;&theta;&#8049;&rho;&alpha;, lute) gives us no
assistance. The &ldquo;harp&rdquo; of <span class="scripRef">Revelation 5:8</span>, <span class="scripRef">14:2</span>, and <span class="scripRef">15:2</span>,
is the cithara or <i>lute</i> again; but neither does this tell us what the
early Christians did or did not do. The inference is pretty strong
that they avoided some things that were Jewish&mdash;and instrumental
music was a marked feature in the Jew&rsquo;s worship&mdash;but it is plain
that (as with the Sabbath question) there was a great deal of blending
at the edges between the two dispensations. We are told,
moreover, that the Syriac Church has always been rich in tunes,
having fully two hundred and seventy-five, while the Greek was
confined to about eight.</p>
<p>There is another fact which comes in just here, however, to
explain what we would otherwise find it hard to unriddle. It
is the matter of the very language of the hymns themselves.</p>
<p>When we observe the places where these fragments occur, or
where singing in the church is mentioned, we find that the language
naturally is Greek. No one doubts that Luke and the
other New Testament writers employed the tongue which was the
educated and flexible medium of conveying the loftiest truth; nor
that Ephesians or Corinthians chanted in Greek. &ldquo;The Greek
tongue,&rdquo; say Conybeare and Howson (<i>St. Paul</i>, 1:10), &ldquo;became
to the Christian more than it had been to the Roman or the Jew.&rdquo;
It lends itself most readily to that dithyrambic shape in which
highly emotional natures could best express their praise. So the
irregularity of the verse; its utter lack of metrical form (as Dr.
Neale found when he examined eighteen quarto volumes of it),
and its simplicity of diction, all combined to put the instrumental
accompaniment aside. Perhaps there was a prejudice&mdash;as Archbishop
Trench affirms&mdash;against a distinctively Jewish method.
Perhaps there was a disposition in this, as in other matters where
art had perverted the morals of men, to oppose whatever looked
toward a possible laxity. Music and banqueting, music and
luxury, music and profligacy, went together so much that the early
Church reacted to the extreme of Puritanism&mdash;forgetting that her
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Lord and Master had often worshipped in the full-choired temple
itself. In the catacombs, where every manner of ordinary symbol
may be found, there is neither pipe nor harp, nor any sort of
musical instrument&mdash;the lyre alone excepted. But neither is there
any condescension to beauty in form or color. Everything betokens
a rude, uncultivated simplicity&mdash;a piety which contented
itself with the barest and meagerest representations. It rose high
enough to portray the face of Christ, in the ancient cemetery of
Domitilla, and in one carving on a sarcophagus of the fourth century.
And, remembering how repugnant anything heathenish
was to the souls of those who associated pipe and tabret and harp
with the bloody arena and the wild revelry of Rome, can we doubt
why they mingled only their unassisted voices in these chants of
praise? It can be positively added that Ambrose, Basil, and
Chrysostom do not include <i>instrumental</i> music in their eulogies
of the Church&rsquo;s practice upon this theme.</p>
<p>We are justified, however, in going one step beyond this bald
statement, that the early Christians <i>sang</i> together. They sang
<i>secum invicem</i>, alternately. The quotations already given show
the adaptation of their hymns to this use. In this, at least, they
were following the Jewish habit of responses and part-singing,
whatever other changes their poverty or prejudices or principles or
persecutions might have produced.</p>
<p>It remains for us to speak of the ancient hymns which have
come down to our day. We have some information as to Harmonius
and Bardesanes, who wrote Syriac hymns in the first century,
but the hymns themselves are either lost or unidentified.
Ephrem Syrus (died 378) furnishes the earliest authentic hymns in
that language. One of these (Daniel, <i>Thesaurus Hymnologicus</i>,
III. 145) is on the Nativity of our Lord, and may be thus rendered,
following Zingerle&rsquo;s German version:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Into his arms with tender love</p>
<p class="t">Did Joseph take his holy son,</p>
<p class="t0">And worshipped him as God, and saw</p>
<p class="t">The babe like any little one.</p>
<p class="t0">His heart rejoiced above him there,</p>
<p class="t">For now the only Good had birth;</p>
<p class="t0">And pious fear upon him came</p>
<p class="t">Before this Judge of all the earth.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, what a lofty wonder!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Who gave me then this precious Son</p>
<p class="t">Of highest God, to be my child?</p>
<p class="t0">For I against thy mother here</p>
<p class="t">Had almost been by zeal beguiled;</p>
<p class="t0">And I had thought to cast her off&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Alas, I saw not truly then</p>
<p class="t0">How in her bosom she should bear</p>
<p class="t">The costliest treasure known to men,</p>

<p class="t">But I sank deep and further down:</p>
<p class="t0">I was no king, but in its stead</p>
<p class="t">A carpenter, and that alone.</p>

<p class="t">That which befits a kingly throne,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There is a trifle of doubt as to which is the very oldest Greek
hymn. One cited by Basil (died 379),</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&Phi;&#8182;&sigmaf; &#7985;&lambda;&alpha;&rho;&#8056;&nu; &#7937;&gamma;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf; &delta;&omicron;&xi;&#8053;&sigmaf;&rdquo;&mdash;&kappa;. &tau;. &lambda;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>has been by some considered the most ancient, and is known to
us as, &ldquo;Hail, gladdening Light.&rdquo; It is wrongly credited to
Athenagenes (died 169), for Basil explicitly denies that authorship.
That which it is safest for us to receive is one found in the works
of Clement of Alexandria, and by him ascribed to an earlier
author. It was probably composed about 200 <span class="small">A.D.</span>; and while it
is too long to quote, it may be characterized as dithyrambic, and
almost Anacreontic, in rhythm. It begins:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&Sigma;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&#8055;&omicron;&nu; &pi;&#8061;&lambda;&omega;&nu; &#7936;&delta;&alpha;&#8182;&nu;.&rdquo;&mdash;&kappa;. &tau;. &lambda;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and is known as &ldquo;Shepherd of Tender Youth,&rdquo; from its best
English version, by the Rev. Dr. H. M. Dexter, of Boston. The
&Phi;&#8182;&sigmaf; &#7985;&lambda;&alpha;&rho;&#8056;&nu;
is also accessible in Longfellow&rsquo;s beautiful translation
in the Golden Legend, commencing, &ldquo;O gladsome light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we turn the pages on which Daniel and Mone have recorded
these hymns of the earliest age of the Church, we observe that
they are either in praise of Christ or of God, or are songs of worship
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
for the morning or the evening. Their simplicity is admirable.
Here is one called &#7974;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;&mdash;an &ldquo;Echo&rdquo;&mdash;literally rendered:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We who have risen from our sleep</p>

<p class="t0">Holy, holy art thou, O God,</p>
<p class="t0">And of thy mercy have pity on us!</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;My hope is God,</p>
<p class="t0">My refuge is the Lord,</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>In such sweet and simple language did the early Christians sing
their &ldquo;praise to Christ, as God.&rdquo; They understood the true
meaning of a hymn as Ambrose and St. Bernard also understood
it&mdash;and as Gregory Nazianzen and Adam of St. Victor never knew
it at all. In 1866 Professor Copp&eacute;e could truly declare that there
was no collection of sacred verse in which this thought of adoration
and of worship was &ldquo;the leading feature.&rdquo; It is better now;
but even to-day there is an honored place for any book of praise
in which the formal and didactic shall be done away, and where
nothing shall be found but the pure reverence of a loving and
trusting soul.</p>
<p>Of old, in the temple, there was kept&mdash;said the rabbins&mdash;a
flute of reed, plain and straight and simple, but of marvellous
sweetness. It came down from Moses&rsquo; day. But the king commanded
his goldsmiths to cover and adorn it with gold and gems.
And, lo, the sweetness of the reed flute was forever gone! Thus,
perchance, in our later art and our foolish wisdom, it may be we
have often spoiled the ancient hymns!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE STUDY OF THE LATIN HYMNS.</span></h2>
<p>The genealogy of the song of praise in the mediaeval and modern
Christian Church is both simple and beautiful. It begins far
back, as we have seen, in the chants and psalms of the Hebrew.
Then it changes to the Syriac and the Greek. Then it emerges
into the Latin. Next it is caught up in the old High-German
poetry, and at length it becomes the modern English hymn. The
line of direct descent is like that of some high and puissant family
whose inheritance is transferred now to one branch and now to
another, but whose noble lineage is never lost.</p>
<p>When the reader or the worshipper is attracted to-day by some
ancient hymn-writer&rsquo;s name, he naturally asks for information.
He is aware that hymnology is called a branch of study, like any
other scholastic pursuit. He is also aware that the more usual
English and German hymns have their historians, and, to a limited
degree, that they have been analyzed, classified, compared, and
their text settled. Even their impelling causes and surroundings
are known, as in the case of the touching lyrics of George Neumark
and Paul Gerhardt, or the pathetic strains of Cowper, or the
stirring notes of Charles Wesley.</p>
<p>But occasionally a bird of strange plumage flies across this
peaceful sky or perches and sings in these religious groves. The
name of some Greek father&mdash;an Anatolius or a John of Damascus&mdash;appears
as the original author. The hymn-horizon widens out
to an earlier age. When one sings the <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>, he
discovers that it has its antecedent in the Greek liturgy. And
when he employs that fine version of Bishop Patrick,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O God, we praise Thee and confess,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>he is put upon a track of inquiry by which he discerns an even
earlier rendering in the oldest prayer-books, beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We praise Thee, God, we knowledge Thee</p>
<p class="t5">The only Lord to be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These little hints and stray gleams of outlook through the mists of
uninformation are intensely alluring. And when by some happy
chance it is learned that this old Latin sequence is traditionally
ascribed to Ambrose, Bishop of Milan; when it is accredited to
the spontaneous utterance of Augustine and his great preceptor at
the time of Augustine&rsquo;s baptism; when it is noted as a derivative
from that Greek psalmody whence the holy Ambrose obtained so
many of his hymns; and when it opens thus a door into the
heaven of the earlier worship of the Church, then indeed the reader
is proportionately stimulated to further question.</p>
<p>For the most part it will be found that the Latin language contains
the best of the Greek, and the inspiration of the majority of
the first German hymns. In the dead ark of the Middle Ages
was kept this rod that budded and this golden pot with its sacred
heavenly food. It is amazing that this treasure has been so well
preserved, but it is none the less certain that we now have it safely,
never to be lost again.</p>
<p>There are no Latin hymns&mdash;let us here say&mdash;earlier than Hilary
of Poitiers (died 366). His <i>Hymnarium</i> has perished, and all but
one of the compositions attributed to himself are doubtful. The
&ldquo;evening-song&rdquo; which he sent to his daughter Abra, while he
was in exile among the followers of the Eastern Church, forms the
connecting link between Greek and Latin hymnody. The true <i>hymn</i>&mdash;a
different thing from the rhythmic but unmetrical <i>sequence</i>&mdash;here
takes its rise. In this small, pure fountain-head reappear
the percolating praises of the two previous centuries. The short
lines drop with a gentle tinkling melody upon the ear. As yet
there is no rhyme, although there is an occasional lightening of
the lyric by some such verbal art.</p>
<p>But with Ambrose the full stream begins to sweep along. There
can be no doubt that many ungathered and traditional stanzas
were in his time discoverable in the Church&mdash;much as it can be
observed that phrases in prayer or in exhortation are the inheritance
of our own generation from days of struggle and of trial among
our Christian ancestors. And what better could a beleaguered
bishop do, when he was shut up in a church &ldquo;for the word of
God and the testimony of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; than to collate these old
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
hymns? Twelve possibly&mdash;eight, or less, with moderate certainty&mdash;can
be regarded as of his own composition. The rest
of the ninety or a hundred are commonly received as &ldquo;Ambrosian,&rdquo;
since they share his spirit and partake in some degree
of his method. The rules of the Venerable Bede are not
infallible, and modern criticism frequently rejects what the early
collectors are disposed to assign to this single illustrious source.</p>
<p>Augustine wrote no actual hymns, but he was the cause of
hymns in others&mdash;as, notably, in the case of Cardinal Peter Damiani.
The Ambrosian music and the Augustinian theology served for
inspiration to many later men. Yet the assignment of these Latin
hymns to their proper authors is, at the best, a most precarious
undertaking. A few, quoted or mentioned by competent witnesses&mdash;as
when Augustine quotes Ambrose&mdash;seem duly authentic.
This is, however, a rare occurrence. Generally we proceed upon
the mere <i>dictum</i> of the first compilers&mdash;especially of Thomasius,
George Fabricius, and Clichtove.</p>
<p>These early compilations are sufficiently scarce. Professor
Dr. H. Ad. Daniel gives a list of some which, except for the
books of &ldquo;the venerable Thilo&rdquo; in the Yale Library, are beyond
the reach of American students. Dating from 1492 and running
into the first decade of the sixteenth century there were many
&ldquo;Expositions&rdquo; of hymns, of which the work of Clichtove (Basle,
1517) remains to us in the greatest number of editions. Up to
the middle of the present century this book was practically indispensable
to any correct knowledge of the original texts. Since
that time it, as well as every similar work, has received attention,
and its contents have been often reproduced.</p>
<p>Other and later laborers are such as Cardinal Thomasius
(Rome, 1741), who follows upon the traces of George Cassander,
the Liberal Catholic (Paris, 1616). We are possibly more indebted
to Cassander than to Thomasius for the correct designation of a good
deal of the authorship. Both of these editors collate the text with
other versions, and thus prepare the way for later and more accurate
work. Both depend to a notable degree upon the book of
George Fabricius (Basle, 1564), which is quite rare; although
Thomasius&rsquo; works are said by Daniel to be sufficiently uncommon
in Germany, as they certainly are in America. The recent republication
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of the Mozarabic Breviary in J. P. Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia</i>
brings this volume, however, within easy reach.</p>
<p>Thus we are naturally led to speak of the sources of the hymns
themselves&mdash;sources from which these editors have secured them.
As a part of religious worship they were incorporated into the
various breviaries, of which hundreds must have been in use before
the unification begun by the Church of Rome in the sixteenth
century. Besides these church books, there were collections of
hymns alone made by mediaeval schools, whose manuscripts still
exist in European libraries.</p>
<p>The only method by which to ascertain the number and extent
of these treasures was to gather and classify them. And strangely
enough this labor has been performed by Protestants rather than
by Catholics. Cassander&rsquo;s book was forbidden at Rome, as he was
what now would be called an Old Catholic; Luther, George Fabricius,
and Hermann Bonn were in no better odor of sanctity; and
for our own times the standard work is that of Herman Adelbert
Daniel, who was a Lutheran professor at Halle, while close
behind him come several others of the same religious belief.</p>
<p>The necessary and highly difficult task of getting the materials
together has been exhaustively performed. Professor Daniel&rsquo;s
investigations extended to the original copies in monasteries and
abbeys almost without number. But F. J. Mone enlarged even
upon this. Daniel&rsquo;s <i>Thesaurus</i> in five volumes was completed in
1856&mdash;having been several years in course of publication&mdash;and it
stands as yet unrivalled. Mone&rsquo;s <i>Lateinische Hymnen des Mittelalters</i>
appeared in 1853-55, and was therefore available for the conclusion
of Daniel&rsquo;s great work. Its value consists in the fact that
it is derived exclusively from manuscripts and from material hitherto
untouched. The Germans, indeed, have made Latin hymnology
a special branch of study, considering that it is profitable to them
for its value religiously and historically. From old Flacius
Illyricus&rsquo; appendix to the <i>Catalogus Testium Veritatis</i> has been
recovered the original of Bernard of Cluny&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jerusalem the
Golden&rdquo;&mdash;a poem which would never have been known by us if
this same Matthias Flacius had not preserved it as a testimony
against the corrupt state of the Church.</p>
<p>We must then add the German names of Schlosser, and Simrock,
and Fortlage, and Stadelmann, and Jacob Grimm, and K&ouml;nigsfeld,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
and B&auml;ssler, and Kayser, and Kehrein, and Morel. Wackernagel
and Koch, the great historians of German hymnology, have also
done admirable service in prefixing the Latin hymns to the earlier
part of their collections and histories of German praise. There is
a host of lesser names, and there have been some separate discoveries
worthy of note. Thus the English ritualists, under the lead
of Newman and Neale, unearthed some capital lyrics. The
<i>Hymni Ecclesiae</i> of Cardinal J. H. Newman, being half derived
from the Paris Breviary, contain hymns which are scarcely to be
found elsewhere&mdash;many of them, as our Index will show, being
accessible only in those pages. The <i>Sequentiae Medii Aevii</i> of Dr.
John Mason Neale also bring to us texts which are extremely
scarce. Archbishop Trench, in his collection of eighty hymns,
has avoided anything like Romanism even to the occasional expurgation
of a phrase; but he has given us a few hymns which
are difficult to procure. K&ouml;nigsfeld&rsquo;s selection of one hundred is admirable;
and B&auml;ssler&rsquo;s and Simrock&rsquo;s little books have made a very
good choice. More recently still Professor F. A. March, of
Lafayette College, has prepared a selection of one hundred and
fifty of these hymns for the use of institutions of learning; and
this, for every purpose, is the finest and most satisfactory series
of texts at our command. The ordinary student can learn much
from this before he needs to attempt the larger and more expensive works.</p>
<p>In making an exhaustive index of all the originals before us,
these collections soon dwindle into a very diminutive form.
There are about three thousand five hundred hymns in the
various books. And they are of all sorts&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent.
The good are the pure and true utterance of pious spirits&mdash;such
lyrics as the <i>Veni, Redemptor</i>, and the <i>Veni, Sancte Spiritus</i>,
and the <i>Vexilla Regis</i>. The positively bad are those which are
either poor in execution&mdash;a common fault&mdash;or decidedly defective
in religious tone. Many so-called &ldquo;hymns&rdquo; are nothing but
plagiaries or parodies upon older compositions. Some are debased
into mere patchwork. There are a few which are macaronic, and
a great many in which poverty of phrase is helped out by wholesale
pilfering. Moreover, it is easy to find those which are highly
objectionable in point of taste and theology, to say nothing of
prosody or Protestantism. And if Protestants are principally
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
energetic in restoring and editing these hymns, to the frank and
generous extent of overlooking what is unpleasant in them, it
ought to follow that they should not be blamed for preferring only
those lyrics in which the broad and Christian fervor of devout
souls can be observed.</p>
<p>Of those hymns which are upon the border line, the pathetic
<i>Stabat Mater</i> may stand as an example. It would be bigotry to
reject it from the list&mdash;as one compiler has done&mdash;while it would
certainly not be fair to Protestants to utilize it, in any close translation,
for the worship of the Church universal.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are not less than from four to five hundred of
these hymns, then, to which no cause of blame can attach&mdash;which
are as dear to the Church of the Roman Catholics as to that of the
Catholic Protestants. On such common ground the heartiest
sympathy and co-operation can develop the riches which yet remain.
Already it is Caswall, the priest, and Newman, the
cardinal, and Neale, the ritualist, who have given to our daily
praise the happiest versions. It is Ozanam who has discovered
several unknown hymns; and Gautier and Digby S. Wrangham
who have brought out Adam of St. Victor; and the ninety-seven
pieces of Abaelard are reprinted from Cousin&rsquo;s text in Migne&rsquo;s
<i>Patrologia</i>. The study of these sacred verses has been comparatively
limited in range and nationality, but it has had the incomparable
advantage of being thorough.</p>
<p>Thus we are to-day possessed of the text of every really fine
sacred Latin lyric. Somewhere or other it has bloomed and has
been gathered by some acute hymnologist. The text, too, is
tolerably clarified. Translations into our own tongue have been
made by such men as Caswall and Newman and Neale (who have
rendered all the hymns of the Roman Breviary), and by Mant,
Chandler, Pearson, Kynaston, and many others. In America the
Rev. Dr. Washburn, Dr. Coles, and Chancellor Benedict have
been as prolific as any. Scattered renderings have obtained place
in various hymnals. And we are now prepared at last for the
general and popular interest which should be taken in this vast
treasure of the Latin tongue.</p>
<p>Nothing is more surprising than the utter misinformation which
prevails. A few scholars, like Dr. Schaff and Dr. William R.
Williams, have endeavored to illuminate our American darkness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
But, speaking only now of the Latin hymns, the story of their
authors remains obscure and the romantic history of their origin
remains for the most part untouched.</p>
<p>Yet Prudentius, the Spaniard, was a classic survival in Spain.
And Damasus, the pope, was associated with certain dramatic
scenes. And Venantius Fortunatus, troubadour and bishop, furnishes
us with a most striking portrait of the times in his attachment
to the abbess-queen, Radegunda. The list presumably
includes Elpis, the wife of Boethius, the &ldquo;last of the Romans;&rdquo;
and Coelius Sedulius, the Briton; and Gregory the Great and
the great archbishop, Rabanus Maurus, and perhaps Robert II.
of France. It calls into fresh life the histories of the Venerable
Bede and of Alcuin; of the two Bernards, the one of Clairvaux
and the other of Cluny; of Peter the Venerable and of Abaelard
and Heloise; of Adam of St. Victor, and Thomas of Celano; of
Bonaventura and Aquinas and &agrave; Kempis and Xavier. It shows
us that mad Solomon, poor Jacoponus; and it leaves us with verses
from John Huss, the martyr, to be read by the light of the Reformation&rsquo;s
dawn.</p>
<p>Thus largely does the subject of the Latin hymns traverse the
ages. From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries of the Christian
era it is the one stream which was fed from Alpine or from Pyrenean
snows&mdash;a &ldquo;river of God that is full of water,&rdquo; which expands
into the stately movement of the Notkerian and Gottschalkian
sequence, or gently murmurs its song of trust with the
missionary Xavier as he writes the exquisite melody of that hymn,
<i>O Deus, ego amo te!</i> To understand and to love these lyrics is
to be better fitted for this nineteenth century of praise. Not the
persecutors and the injurious, not the cruel and the cold-hearted
will then remain to us; but the <i>Dies Irae</i> will utter its trumpet-voice
above the dead phrases of a formal service, and the <i>Salve
caput cruentatum</i> will call us afresh to the foot of the cross.</p>

<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">HILARY OF POITIERS AND THE EARLIEST LATIN HYMNS.</span></h2>
<p>When Master Peter Abaelard was preparing his own hymns for
use in the Abbey of the Paraclete, he prefaced them with a brief
treatise. There were ninety-three of them, arranged for all the
services of Heloise and her nuns, and he answers the request of
his abbess-wife by sending them, somewhere in the neighborhood
of the year 1135. &ldquo;At the instance of thy requests, my sister
Heloise,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;formerly dear in the world and now most
dear in Christ, I have composed what are called in Greek, &lsquo;hymns,&rsquo;
and in Hebrew, &lsquo;tillim.&rsquo;&rdquo; For it is plain that she has a vivid
recollection of his &ldquo;wild, unhallowed rhymes, writ in his unbaptized
times,&rdquo; and she would now have him tune his lyre, as
Robert Herrick did, to a loftier strain.</p>
<p>Hence he made for these gentle sisters a hymn-book of their
own, and so became the Watts or Wesley of their matins and
vespers. With characteristic self-confidence he only included
what he had himself prepared; but this introduction casts a great
deal of light upon the knowledge and piety of the time respecting
hymns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; continues Abaelard, &ldquo;that you asked me for
an explanation. &lsquo;We know,&rsquo; you said, &lsquo;that the Latin, and
especially the French Church, have in psalms, and also in hymns,
followed more a custom than an authority.&rsquo;&rdquo; This was quite
true; and the remark is eminently characteristic of Heloise, whose
scholarship was admirable, and whose disposition was of a sort to
crave for and cling to a stronger nature. He then quotes for her
the decree of the fourth Council of Toledo (<span class="small">A.D.</span> 633), by which
Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose of Milan are established as the
great fathers of Christian song in the Western Church, and by
which the praise of God in hymns is sanctioned and commended.</p>
<p>To much the same effect are the words of Augustine of Hippo,
centuries earlier. His beloved mother, Monica, had died, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
nothing appeared to comfort him so much as one of these same
holy songs. &ldquo;Then I slept, and woke up again and found my
grief not a little softened; and as I was alone in my bed, I
remembered those true verses of thy Ambrose. For thou art the</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Maker of all, the Lord</p>
<p class="t">And Ruler of the height,</p>
<p class="t0">Who, robing day in light, hast poured</p>
<p class="t">Soft slumbers o&rsquo;er the night,</p>
<p class="t0">That to our limbs the power</p>
<p class="t">Of toil may be renewed,</p>
<p class="t0">And hearts be raised that sink and cower,</p>
<p class="t">And sorrows be subdued.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the <i>Deus creator omnium</i> of the great bishop of Milan;
and this, in consequence of Augustine&rsquo;s quotation, is among the
best authenticated and earliest hymns of the Latin Church.</p>
<p>But there were more ancient hymns than the Ambrosian or
Augustinian. They bear the name of Hilary, and with them
Latin hymnology really begins. It is true that in the previous
century&mdash;the third&mdash;Cyprian of Carthage had written religious
poetry, but he composed nothing which could be sung. There
is, indeed, nothing previous to Hilary.</p>
<p>And now let us go back to the creation of this first and noblest
light. For Hilary had been a heathen&mdash;a heathen of the heathen&mdash;in
Roman Gaul. He was born in Poitiers (Pictavium) about
the beginning of the fourth century. His father&rsquo;s name was
Francarius, whose tomb&mdash;although he must at first have lived as
an idolater&mdash;is said by Bouchet to have been &ldquo;for upward of
fifteen hundred years&rdquo; in the parish church of Clissonium (Clisson,
near Nantes). We are indebted to Jerome for the main facts
of Hilary&rsquo;s life, and to Fortunatus for a large share in the filling
up of the outlines. Hilary was so celebrated a man that contemporary
references are more abundant and helpful in his career even
than in that of Shakespeare. In those days he was at the summit
of renown, a notable exception to the case of the prophet, &ldquo;not
being without honor save in his own country.&rdquo; &ldquo;For who,&rdquo;
says Augustine, &ldquo;does not know Hilary the Gallic bishop?&rdquo;
And Jerome wrote to St. Eustacia that Hilary and Cyprian were
the &ldquo;two great cedars of the age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was doubtless well educated. His Latin was good and
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
copious, without possessing very great polish. His Greek was
sufficient to fit him to translate the creeds of the Eastern Church,
and to become familiar with their hymns. We have his own
testimony that he lived in comfort, if not in luxury; and the
inference is plain that his family were of consequence in the
place. It was in his leisure that he took up Moses and the
prophets; and there, in that famous old town of his birth, the
mists of his idolatry thinned away. We do not know that any
external pressure was brought to bear upon his mind, or that he
was led by anything except a natural curiosity into this new
learning.</p>
<p>Poitiers itself is a noble situation for such an intellect. It is
perched on a promontory, and surrounded on all sides by gorges
and narrow valleys. The isthmus, which joins it back to the
ridge, was once walled and ditched across. The Pictavi, and
afterward the Romans, understood the military advantages of the
spot. It has always been the abode of scholars and of warriors.
Here Francis Bacon once studied. Here Clovis, founder of the
Merovingian dynasty, beat Alaric II., in 507, in fair battle. Here
Radegunda the Holy lies buried. Here Fortunatus, the poet-bishop,
dwelled. Here Charles Martel hammered the Saracens in
732. Here, in the Cathedral of St. Pierre, rest the ashes of
Richard Coeur de Lion. Here, beneath these walls, fought
Edward the Black Prince against King John of France, in 1356,
when the English had the best of the day. For they had learned&mdash;as
Bishop Hugh Latimer says that he himself was taught&mdash;how
to draw the cloth-yard shaft to a head, and let it fly with a deadly
aim. &ldquo;In my tyme,&rdquo; said Latimer, &ldquo;my poore father was as
diligent to teach me to shote as to learne anye other thynge, and
so I thynke other menne dyd theyr children. Hee taughte me
how to drawe, how to laye my bodye in my bowe, and not to drawe
with strength of armes as other nacions do, but with strength of
the bodye. I had my bowes boughte me accordyng to my age
and strength; as I encreased in them, so my bowes were made
bigger and bigger; for men shall never shoot well excepte they be
broughte up in it.&rdquo; (Sixth sermon before Edward VI.) It was
such archery as this that laid the flower of France in the dust, and
put John, their king, into prison.</p>
<p>Poitiers is thus a noble and appropriate birthplace for one who
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
before the time of Charles the Hammerer was called the &ldquo;Hammer
of the Arians&rdquo; (<i>Malleus Arianorum</i>), and who combined fighting
with praying all through his life. Places and circumstances and
the untamable blood of heroes have more to do with the making
of men than we suppose; and Hilary was so distinctly a son of
Caesar&rsquo;s Gaul that he became its large, true, and free expression,
appropriate to its landscape and harmonized to its atmosphere.</p>
<p>And as to his emergence from heathenism, there can be nothing
more satisfactory to us than his own story. He has recorded that
when he found, in Exodus, how God was called &ldquo;I am that I am,&rdquo;
and when he read in Isaiah (40:12) of a deity who &ldquo;held the wind
in His fists,&rdquo; and again (66:1) of Him who said, &ldquo;Heaven is
My throne and earth is My footstool,&rdquo; then this <i>Deus immensus</i>
surpassed all his heathen conceptions of grandeur and power.
And when he read (in Ps. 138:7) how this great God loved and
cared for His children, so that one could say, &ldquo;Though I walk
in the midst of trouble, Thou wilt revive me; Thou shalt stretch
forth Thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy
right hand shall save me&rdquo;&mdash;then he was drawn toward this mighty
being by a sentiment of confidence and trust. He also&mdash;turning
the pages of the Wisdom of Solomon (13:5) in the Apocrypha&mdash;found
it written that &ldquo;by the greatness and beauty of the
creatures proportionately the Maker of them is seen.&rdquo; And then,
encountering the Gospel of John, its opening sentences clarified
his mind. All became plain. He accepted with calmness, firmness,
and dignity the great doctrines of the Christian faith. He
was imbued with John&rsquo;s conception of that Word, &ldquo;which was in
the beginning&rdquo; and &ldquo;which was God.&rdquo; From that moment he
had a theology which was as pure as crystal and as indestructible
as adamant. There is no muddiness about his ideas from this
time onward, though Arians buzz and sting, and calamities rain
upon him, and the path of duty is deep with mire and the future
is dark. Every one of these things passes away. His own language
as to this great change in his belief is as characteristic as it
is beautiful: &ldquo;I extended my desires further, and longed that the
good thoughts I had about God, and the good life which I built
on them, might have an eternal reward.&rdquo; Like one of his own
favorite saints in the Gospel and the Apocalypse of John, he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
thus &ldquo;led by the Spirit of God&rdquo; to become one of the chanting
choir before the throne.</p>
<p>It matters very little, therefore, to us of to-day, that, in 1851,
Pius IX., himself a man of sweet and gentle temper, made Hilary
a &ldquo;Doctor of the Church&rdquo;&mdash;a distinction reserved for those greatest
ones, like Augustine and Chrysostom, whose learning and
eloquence are world-renowned. The dead bishop did not need
this posthumous distinction. He has long been recognized&mdash;to
quote Professor Dorner&mdash;as &ldquo;one of the most original and profound,&rdquo;
albeit not the easiest to understand at all times, of the
great teachers of the Christian Church. We may hereafter attach
more value to his work even than we do at present.</p>
<p>This then was the man who had determined to enter upon a
Christian life. He was already married and had one daughter&mdash;Abra
by name&mdash;and possessed a certain repute as a man of reading
and of affairs. His origin protected him from a contempt of
pagan learning; and his marriage protected him from that one-sided
development which has Romanized the once Catholic
Church. The period in which he lived was one of transition&mdash;from
classic literature to Christian literature, and from the Latin
of far-off Virgil and Cicero to the Latin which was to become the
uniting tongue of all scholars in that Babel of the Middle Ages.
This language was now shaping itself to its new work and becoming,
like English under the genius of Chaucer, a living speech.
In the moulding hands of these first Christian writers it became
flexible, not always fluent or graceful or even strictly grammatical,
but capable at least to carry what would otherwise have been lost.
Greek was gone, and French and German and English had not
yet appeared. As a Gallo-Roman, then&mdash;a post-classic Latinist&mdash;Hilary
gives in his allegiance to Christianity, and his wife and
daughter are baptized with him into the true faith.</p>
<p>So far much is conjectural; and more is vague and to be derived
from the shadows cast upon the screen of history by the
&ldquo;spirit of the years to come yearning to mix itself with life.&rdquo;
We emerge, however, into historical certainty about the year 351.
Then, on the death of their bishop&mdash;who is thought to have been
Maxentius, the brother of St. Maximin of Trier&mdash;his townspeople
clamored for Hilary. The <i>Histoire Litteraire de la France</i> sets
this election down for the year 350; but that authority, in this and
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
a great many other instances, is profuse and multitudinous and
not absolutely safe. We are certainly not far out from the correct
date in saying 351.</p>
<p>It illustrates a condition of things which are suggestive of the
simplicity of the early Church, when we find that in spite of his
being a married man and a father&mdash;and in spite of Cyprian&rsquo;s and
of Tertullian&rsquo;s praises of celibacy&mdash;Hilary was heartily chosen and
almost forced into the episcopate. In this position he exhibited &ldquo;all
the excellent qualities of the great bishops.&rdquo; We are told that he
was &ldquo;gentle and peaceable, given particularly to an ability to persuade
and to influence.&rdquo; With these he joined &ldquo;a holy vigor
which held him firm against rising heresies.&rdquo; And Cassian says
that Hilary &ldquo;had all the virtues of an incomparable man.&rdquo; The
fact, after all, speaks for itself more loudly than these commendations.
He was so much one of themselves that the people of
Poitiers would not have selected him, if they had not known him
to be the best man for the mitre.</p>
<p>From this time began that career of stainless honor which has
outlasted the very walls which echoed his voice. He was known
from Great Britain to the Indies. He ranks second only to
Athanasius as a defender of the faith; and&mdash;as we already noted&mdash;he
is classed by Jerome with the great bishop of Hippo whose
portrait is given to us so vividly in Charles Kingsley&rsquo;s <i>Hypatia</i>.
And to us of our century and of our convictions in favor of charity
and culture, it is particularly praiseworthy that he never gave up
his secular scholarship, and that he never flagged or faltered in
defending opinions which were as large and liberal as they were
undeniably orthodox. He was an oak which stood against the
blast unshaken, and which yet held, in the heart of its great
branches, sweet nests of singing birds and leafy coverts of shade
and peace.</p>
<p>Hilary was not suffered to be inactive. It was the period at
which the Arian heresy was in full incandescence. No one holding
the opinions of the Bishop of Poitiers could well remain
neutral. He had&mdash;in conformity with a custom soon to become
a law&mdash;separated his life from that of his home; but he appears
always to have cherished a warm love for his wife and child. This
placed him, however, in perfect freedom from other cares, and at
liberty to devote himself to the eradication of false doctrine. Constantius,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the Emperor, was an Arian, and this made the perplexity
of the position very great. An honest man might ruin all by his
blunt independence&mdash;but an honest man dare not be silent. And,
besides, Hilary had neither attended the Synod of Arles (353) nor
that of Milan (355), and was somewhat out of the ecclesiastical tide.</p>
<p>That he was no coward was soon shown to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.
He prepared a letter to the Emperor as brave as it was
keen, and which touched up with a vigorous lash the cringing
sycophants and shuffling hypocrites about the court. Hilary is
notably strong when he denounces the substitution of force for
reason&mdash;and perhaps his doctorate came to him only in 1851
(when he could not well care much for it) because this doctrine
of his was not altogether what Mother Church has been in the
habit of teaching and practising! I may refer to the recent work
of the Rev. R. T. Smith upon <i>The Church in Roman Gaul</i> as fully
confirming this statement. St. Martin of Tours is there called to
bear testimony that the Bishop of Poitiers held such opinions just
as sturdily in his days of power as in these times of trial and persecution.
He was, in short, a thoroughly sincere man, and it took
him only a few years&mdash;until 355&mdash;to get into the hottest bubbling
spot of all the caldron. At that date, in company with other
leaders of the church in Gaul, he drove out a very pestilent fellow&mdash;Saturninus,
the Bishop of Arles&mdash;as a seditious and irreconcilable
element in their midst. With him was cast out Valens, and
with Valens was cast out Ursacius. But of all these, Bishop
Saturninus was the angriest and the most revengeful.</p>
<p>A year of something like good order followed, when lo, the
Arians came to the front with a synod of their own complexion at
Beziers. Here Hilary found himself in the vocative case altogether.
The tables were turned upon him, and it was he who
must now go forth a banished man. The power was against him,
and he set out with bowed head and sad heart upon one of those
pride-humbling journeys which have not seldom brought the
greatest results to religion, and which not a few of the best men
have taken in their day. In this manner Bernard went to meet
Abaelard; Martin Luther went to the diet at Worms; and John
Bunyan took his way to Bedford jail.</p>
<p>Principal among the causes of his sadness was that he was
snatched away from his constant and congenial duty of explaining
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the Scriptures to the people of his diocese. Still he had nothing
for it but to go; and so, somewhere about 356, we find him in
Phrygia. He is accompanied by Rodanius, Bishop of Toulouse,
who had plucked up considerable courage by seeing how well
Hilary took his defeat.</p>
<p>In 357 the Church in Roman Gaul sent him their greeting,
from which that of his own Poitiers people was not absent. And
the Gallic bishops, having perceived him to be capable of much
good service in his enforced residence abroad, bade him inform
himself and them upon the creeds and customs of the Eastern
Church. This he had already, to a degree, undertaken. And
in 359, whom do we find entering a convocation of bishops at
Seleucia but our very Hilary, opposing with a strong and unflinching
philosophic power all those&mdash;and there were many there&mdash;who
denied the consubstantiality of the Word.</p>
<p>There were one hundred and sixty of these bishops at Seleucia,
of whom one hundred and five&mdash;a very handsome majority&mdash;were
&ldquo;semi-Arians.&rdquo; Of the remaining fifty-five there were nineteen
classed as Anomoeans&mdash;those who held that the Son was
<i>unlike</i> the Father in essence, or
&#7936;&nu;&#8057;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;&mdash;and
the rest were
heretics of different grades of badness. It was the natural
outcome of the difficulties with Athanasius, where the royal
authority was on the side of the Arians. The Roman Catholic
historians are therefore not complimentary to this synod&mdash;or
rather &ldquo;double council&rdquo; of Seleucia and Rimini&mdash;and this
was assuredly no very comfortable body of Christians for a banished
bishop to exhort. But he did it with effect, and proceeded
to the council at Constantinople (360) and did it again; and
presently (361) Constantius died and the Nicene Creed was victorious.</p>
<p>So was Hilary, who&mdash;in 360-61&mdash;returned to Poitiers, where,
as soon as his crozier was once more well in hand, he levelled
Saturninus and compelled him to abandon his diocese. He then
turned upon Auxentius of Milan, who only escaped the same or
a worse fate by clinging to Valentinian, the reigning Emperor,
and was denounced by Hilary as a hypocrite for his pains. Our
bishop appears in these days to have been decidedly a member of
the Church Militant; and perhaps it was natural enough when
one had survived the reigns of Constantius, Julian the Apostate,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
and Jovian, for him to be as he was. I am not commenting
upon these exciting scenes; I desire rather to go back and show
how they produced the hymns of which we are to speak.</p>
<p>It was in 357&mdash;at the same date with the letters from the bishops
and from the churches&mdash;that Abra, his daughter, wrote to him
herself. From this epistle we learn that her mother still lived,
and we observe the dutiful and loving daughter apparent in every
line. In reply Hilary sends a well-composed and even imaginative
letter. Under the figures of a pearl and a garment he
charges her to keep her soul and her conduct pure. He rather
recommends a single life, but not in any such extravagant eulogy
of celibacy as some would have us suppose. It is more after the
style of what Grynaeus affirmed of him&mdash;that he was so moderate
in these opinions as to suffer his canons to marry&mdash;since it would
be hard for an unbiassed mind to draw any harsh conclusions from
the language; yet all this is of small consequence compared with
the enclosure&mdash;two Latin hymns, one for the morning and one
for the evening, which she may use in the worship of God. The
first of these is the <i>Lucis largitor splendide</i>; but the second is
probably lost. It is said that it was the hymn, <i>Ad coeli clara non
sum dignus sidera</i>&mdash;&ldquo;To the clear stars of heaven I am not worthy,&rdquo;
etc. This is very doubtful indeed, so much so that we may
decline to receive it on several grounds. It is to be found in the
superb folio edition of Hilary&rsquo;s works (Paris, 1693) prepared by
the Benedictines of St. Maur. Yet if internal evidence is to weigh
at all we must reject it without scruple. It is not a hymn in any
true sense, and certainly has no reference to the <i>evening</i> hour of
worship. It contains a gross phrase or two, which are not suggestive
of Hilary, who would scarcely have said that he would &ldquo;despise
Arius&rdquo; by &ldquo;modulating a hymn&rdquo; against him, nor would
he have spoken of the &ldquo;barking Sabellius&rdquo; or the &ldquo;grunting
Simon.&rdquo; The verses are unpleasantly flavored with earthliness,
and to think that a young girl would be inclined to sing ninety-six
lines of an abecedary&mdash;or &ldquo;alphabet-hymn&rdquo;&mdash;is absurd.
Moreover, the editors of the edition of 1693 only print four stanzas,
and express their own disbelief that Hilary wrote it, based upon
these facts and upon their no less important criticism of the style,
which is <i>masculine</i> throughout, and refers to ideas highly inappropriate
to the use intended. Mone is nearer to the correct doctrine
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
when he assigns it to a period between the sixth and eighth centuries.
Daniel (4:130) prints it in full and quotes Mone&rsquo;s remark
that an Irish monk is likely to have been its author. It is
in the metre familiar to modern eyes in the <i>Integer vitae</i> of Horace,
but it displays neither taste nor poetry nor any religious fervor.
That it begins each stanza with a consecutive letter of the alphabet
is no proof of anything except wasted ingenuity. So that, I
repeat, we do well to reject it and to leave it rejected.</p>
<p>All, then, that is left us is the <i>Lucis largitor splendide</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
splendid giver of the light.&rdquo; The letter went back from Seleucia
to Poitiers and carried this hymn, at least, with it. Hilary had
sent this and its companion, <i>ut memor mei semper sis</i>&mdash;&ldquo;that
you may always remember me.&rdquo; And we may fancy the lovely
high-born daughter of that earnest and scholarly man as, daily and
nightly, she sits at her window&mdash;perchance with her gaze wistfully
turned to the eastward. There she sang these simple, beautiful
hymns&mdash;she the first singer of the new hymns of the Latin Church.
Among the themes for Christian art yet left to us there is hardly
one more suggestive than this&mdash;for Abra doubtless sang her father&rsquo;s
hymns to her father&rsquo;s loyal people. It may even be supposed
that he gave her the tunes as well as the words, and that, by
morning and by night, the battle-scarred Poitiers re-echoed this
voice of the exiled bishop.</p>
<p>Of the hymn itself as much can be said in favor as we have
just said against its pretended and ill-matched companion. It
breathes the Johannean sentiments throughout. It celebrates the
Light, the Son of God, the glory of the Father, &ldquo;clearer than the
full sun, the perfect light and day itself.&rdquo; To one who is acquainted
with the Greek hymns it is instantly suggestive of those
pellucid songs&mdash;its atmosphere is all peace and its trust is as restful
to the tired spirit as the quiet coming of the rising day. It
may easily have been a translation from the Greek, or, even more
easily, the natural up-gush of melody which was touched into life
by the frequent hearing of the Eastern hymns. Hilary never
learned it in an Arian church, nor did he find it among controversialists.
Its nest, where it was first reared, was in some corner of
a catacomb or in some nook of the Holy Land. This hymn,
then, we may safely accept as the oldest authentic original Latin
&ldquo;song of praise to Christ as God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Whether the Bishop of Poitiers had much or little learning, he
wrote a valuable book on <i>Synods</i>, and translated for us many
useful and otherwise inaccessible confessions of faith and statements
of doctrine. Erasmus&mdash;himself no brave man, nor one
likely to estimate moral courage properly&mdash;calls this letter to
Abra &ldquo;<i>nugamentum hominis otiose indocti</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the trifling production
of a man lazily uneducated! Well, perhaps it would have been
as well if some of that same &ldquo;luxurious ignorance&rdquo; of Hilary could
have secured the &ldquo;laborious learning&rdquo; of Erasmus from exhibiting,
at the end of life, its own inefficiency. Jerome said that
whoever found fault with Hilary&rsquo;s knowledge was compelled to
concede his philosophic skill; and it reminds one of the remark
of Dante Rossetti, who said that nothing in our age could stand
comparison with a sonnet of Shakespeare, for, rough as it might
seem, <i>Shakespeare wrote it</i>. It was this manhood behind the Latin
which went for more than all Rotterdam!</p>
<p>Hilary is credited with a great deal, doubtless, that he never
wrote. So he is, by Fortunatus, with miracles which he never
performed. Alcuin and others assign to him the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>,
but this was certainly more ancient than Hilary, being quoted
by Athanasius in his treatise on Virginity. He could at best
merely have translated it. This he might also have done for the
<i>Te Deum laudamus</i>. And since we know that he prepared a <i>Liber
Hymnorum</i>&mdash;the first actual hymn-book of the Western Church&mdash;we
have some reason to think that he would not have altogether
forgotten the greatest chants of the early Christians. This hymn-book
is utterly lost to us. This is not the same as the <i>Liber
Mysteriorum</i>&mdash;the book of the mysteries&mdash;and its existence, like
that of its companion work, rests upon the testimony of Jerome.
Doubtless in it there were other poems and songs from which the
Hilarian authorship has been broken or lost. It was not the
ancient custom either to preserve the author&rsquo;s name, or even to
retain the precise form of his hymn. He threw his little lyric&mdash;as
the Israelites did their jewelry&mdash;into the common treasury of
the Church; and in the Breviaries, where so many of these hymns
are to be discovered, a later and more critical scholarship may
identify some of them hereafter. As delicate insects are preserved
in amber, we there find much that we should otherwise have lost;
but, like that very amber, when its electricity is excited, his was
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
that sort of reputation which attracted many anonymous trifles&mdash;as,
for example, the <i>Ad coeli clara</i>&mdash;to itself.</p>
<p>Of Hilary&rsquo;s other writings, with exception of his work on the
Councils of Ariminum and Seleucia, we have the full text. His
commentaries on the Psalms and on Matthew; his controversial
pamphlets against Constantius; his book of <i>Synods</i>; his twelve
books <i>De Trinitate</i>&mdash;these are accessible in the <i>Patrologia</i> of Migne.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly believed at the time of the fourth Council
of Toledo that he had written many pieces &ldquo;in favor of God, and
of the triumphs of apostles and martyrs;&rdquo; and both Jerome and
Isidore of Seville declare him to have been the first among the
Latins to write Christian verse. But to show how uncertain is the
conjecture that is thus started, I may mention that the <i>Ut queant
laxis</i> of Paul Winfrid, the &ldquo;Deacon,&rdquo; is credited to Hilary by
the <i>Histoire Litteraire</i>. The same authority also claims for him
the first <i>Pange lingua</i> (<i>Pange lingua gloriosi, praelium certaminis</i>),
which is sometimes assigned to Claudianus Mamertus, but is the
well-authenticated composition of Venantius Fortunatus, the
troubadour and friend of Radegunda, the wife of Clotaire. We
may as well admit that a great man did not necessarily do all the
great things of his day.</p>
<p>Besides, the search after truth in this matter is complicated marvellously
by the trade of the hymn-tinkers, who put new bottoms
and tops and sides to a great many religious lyrics. Here is a
case in point in Mone (vol. iii., p. 633). The hymn begins
<i>Christum rogemus et patrem</i>&mdash;&ldquo;We call on Christ and on the
Father.&rdquo; It has seven stanzas. The <i>first</i> stanza is from a morning
hymn, supposed to be by Hilary. The <i>second</i> is from an
Ambrosian hymn. The <i>third</i> and <i>fourth</i> are from another Ambrosian
hymn to the Archangel Michael. The <i>fifth</i> is from a very
noble Ambrosian hymn&mdash;the <i>Aeterna Christi munera</i>&mdash;of which
Daniel says that it itself has been &ldquo;wretchedly torn to pieces by
the Church&rdquo; (<i>ab ecclesia miser e dilaceratum</i>). The <i>sixth</i> and <i>seventh</i>
stanzas are also Ambrosian&mdash;from the <i>Jesu corona virginum</i>.
Thus this single hymn of seven stanzas is mere patchwork, gathered
from that Ambrosian hymnody which the Breviaries supply.
And finding all the rest of it credited to Ambrose and to his century,
we are inclined to doubt that Hilary should be considered as
the author of any portion at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Indeed the identification of Hilary&rsquo;s hymns&mdash;except the <i>Lucis
largitor</i>&mdash;is purely conjectural. It rests mainly on the hymnological
acumen of Cardinal Thomasius, which may or may not be
liable to error. Kayser refuses, on one ground or another, to
positively endorse any, except the one which all now concede.
Next to this in probability stands the <i>Beata nobis gaudia</i> (though
it is doubted by Professor March), and then the <i>Deus pater ingenite</i>,
which is taken from the Mozarabic Breviary. The <i>Jam meta noctis
transiit</i>, the <i>In matutinis surgimus</i>, and the <i>Jesu refulsit omnium</i>,
have only the authority of Thomasius. The <i>Jesu quadragenariae</i>,
Daniel says, is an old hymn, but very certainly composed later
than the time of Hilary. The <i>Ad coeli clara</i> we have already rejected.
Thus we have one authentic and five conjectural Hilarian
hymns. There is, however, great doubt resting on the <i>Jesu
refulsit omnium</i>; and if I consulted merely my own judgment,
I should declare against it, if only in view of the <i>rhymes</i>&mdash;a characteristic
which it would scarcely possess if it were genuinely of
the fourth century. And while we are upon this somewhat ungrateful
duty of trying to set matters right, shall we pass over the
slip which Mrs. Charles makes in her capital little book? (<i>Christian
Life in Song.</i> Am. ed., p. 74.) For she says that &ldquo;The
Hilary who wrote the hymns was the canonized Bishop of Arles.&rdquo;
There was, much later, a Hilary of Arles; and there was another
Hilary of Rome, and there were also others of the same name;
but none of them wrote hymns. He of Arles assuredly did not.</p>
<p>Of our own Hilary it may be added that the rest of his life was
earnest, but comparatively quiet. We shall find Gregory of Tours
and Fortunatus asserting that he raised the dead and healed the
sick, and cast out devils (some of them in the shape of snakes)
from a boy&rsquo;s stomach; but these stories belong naturally to a
credulous and superstitious age. More to the purpose is it to find
that the bishop had entered upon the composition of tunes for his
hymns, and had taken up calligraphy and the ornamentation of
manuscripts. There was a book of the Gospels found, on which
was indorsed, &ldquo;<i>Quem scripsit Hilarius Pictavensis quondam
sacerdos</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;which Hilary of Poitiers, formerly a priest, wrote.&rdquo;
A similar book was left by St. Perpetuus, Bishop of Tours, to
Bishop Euphronius, Fortunatus&rsquo;s friend. This is attested by his
will, executed in 474. &ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; says Christian Druthmar (ninth
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
century), &ldquo;a book of the Gospels, written in Greek, which was
said to have been St. Hilary&rsquo;s, in which were Matthew and John,&rdquo;
etc. But whether Hilary wrote this is naturally an open question.</p>
<p>The good bishop died at Poitiers&mdash;as Jerome and Gregory of
Tours declare&mdash;but the date is still a matter of some uncertainty.
Valentinian and Valens were upon the throne, and it is safe to say
that 367-68 was the year. January 14th has also been assigned
by some authorities, but with no better reason than a generally
received tradition to this effect, and the fact that this is his day in
the Roman calendar. His body was, however, scattered rather
widely. It was removed from its tomb in the time of Clovis&mdash;a
bone of his arm was in Belgium, and some other portions of his
anatomy were in Limoges. About the year 638, Dagobert is
stated to have placed his remains in the Church of St. Dionysius,
and so confident of this fact were the people of Poitiers, in 1394,
that they vehemently asserted that they had his relics there in perfect
safety. &ldquo;Calvinistic heretics&rdquo; were said to have burned the
mortal remnants of the great &ldquo;hammer of the Arians,&rdquo; and the
Pictavians took this method to meet the calumny. For aught we
know to the contrary they were perfectly right, and the dust of
their bishop is still resting peacefully in their midst.</p>
<p>For his works, the Paris edition of 1693 is the best; but the
<i>Patrologia</i> of J. P. Migne contains all that any one can need or
care to see. It is the full reprint of the Paris volumes, together
with biographical and critical notes, in Latin, prepared with great
diligence and research; but, of course, from the Roman Catholic
point of view.</p>

<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">POPE DAMASUS AND THE BEGINNING OF RHYME.</span></h2>
<p>Contemporary with Hilary of Poitiers, but probably a younger
man, as he survived him by seventeen years, was Damasus of
Rome. Like many other Romans of the imperial period, he was
a Spaniard by birth; or, at least, he was the son of a Spaniard who
had removed to Rome and had become a deacon or presbyter of
the church dedicated to the memory of the Roman martyr, St.
Lawrence. Of his own earlier life we know very little. An extant
epitaph records the fact that he had a sister who became a nun
and died in her twentieth year. He himself served in the Church
of St. Lawrence until his sixtieth year, when he was chosen
Bishop of Rome; and in the accepted catalogue, which begins
with the Apostle Peter, he ranks as the thirty-sixth bishop of the
see.</p>
<p>He was chosen bishop in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 366, because of the position he
had taken with reference to the controversy which then agitated
the diocese, and because of the firmness and weight of character
he had displayed in the troubles of the years before his election.
The great Christological controversy was agitating the Church of
both East and West. The West was substantially in agreement
with Athanasius, against both the Arians and the semi-Arians, and
would have been entirely so but for the influence exerted by semi-Arian
or Arian emperors and the courtly bishops of their party.
Constantius, the last surviving son of Constantine the Great, was
exceedingly zealous for the semi-Arian doctrine, which rejected the
statement of our Lord&rsquo;s substantial identity with His Father, but
was willing to assert His substantial likeness. It was only the
difference of an iota in a Greek
word&mdash;&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
or &#8001;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;&mdash;but
if there ever was a case in which neither jot nor tittle must
be allowed to pass away, it was this.</p>
<p>Liberius, who was elected Bishop of Rome in 352, was the victim
of Constantius&rsquo;s policy. In 353 the East and West were united
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
under his rule, and that year at Arles, as in 355 at Milan, councils
were called, in which the condemnation of Athanasius was procured
by imperial blandishments. In the former the presbyter
sent by Liberius to represent the Roman see subscribed with the
majority. But in the second his three representatives obeyed
their instructions, and accepted disfavor and exile rather than
subscribe. Then Liberius himself was summoned to Milan, and
the weight of imperial threats and persuasions was brought to bear
upon him. He withstood both manfully, and demanded as a
preliminary to any discussion of the charges against Athanasius,
that the Nicene Creed should be subscribed by all parties, and the
banished bishops returned to their sees. When given his choice
between submission and exile, he chose the latter.</p>
<p>The Emperor now sought among the Roman clergy for a man
to put into Liberius&rsquo;s place. In Rome, as in most of the cities
of the West, Arians were not to be found. But in the Deacon
Felix the court party obtained a candidate who, while himself a
Trinitarian, was willing to hold communion with the Arians, and
presumably to condemn Athanasius. Of the details of his election
and ordination little is known, but we find him installed in the
Roman see with the vigorous support of the civil authority,
although not with the assent of the Roman people. The great
body of the Christians in Rome are said to have refused communion
with him because he was tainted by communion with
heretics; and when Constantius came to visit the city, he was
besieged by the Christian ladies of the city with appeals for the
restoration of Liberius.</p>
<p>In the mean time three years of exile to Thrace, where he was
thrown of set purpose into constant association with bishops of
the semi-Arian party, and isolated from his friends, had broken
the spirit of Liberius. He was not a man of strong character, and,
unfortunately for the theory of papal infallibility, he yielded. He
signed a creed compiled for the occasion, which described Christ
as of <i>like</i> substance with the Father, and condemned Athanasius.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
He then was allowed to return to Rome, although Felix II. was
still the recognized bishop. Constantius seems to have foreseen
the difficulties which would attend the presence of the two bishops
in the city, and he consented to the return of Liberius unwillingly.
The body of the people and of the clergy at once rallied around
Liberius, and rejected Felix altogether; and of this party was
Damasus. But while they were willing to condone his weakness
in the matter of condemning Athanasius, there was a party of
more determined Athanasians who refused to do so, and the
diocese now was divided between the three factions. That of
Felix disappeared with his own death in 360 and the death of
Constantius in 361. But the extreme Athanasians, although they
did not attempt to set up a rival bishop while Liberius lived, perpetuated
their party, and they probably received aid and comfort
from a similar party which had arisen in the East, in opposition to
the wiser and more charitable policy of Athanasius himself. This
party was called the Luciferians, from Lucifer, Bishop of Cagliari,
in Sardinia, who was in exile in the East at the time when this
question was raised there after the death of Constantius.</p>
<p>In 367 Liberius died, and the schism at once showed itself in
Rome. Damasus was chosen and ordained bishop in the regular
form by the friends of Liberius, who were the great majority.
But the Deacon Ursicinus was chosen by the Luciferian party, and
ordained by bishops of that party in the basilica of St. Sicinus.
Unfortunately the prefect of the city was a weak and ineffective
man, who was quite unable to preserve peace between the two
factions. It soon came to blows between them, and the pagan
historian, Ammianus Marcellinus, tells us with what result:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Damasus and Ursinus being eager beyond measure to secure possession
of the bishop&rsquo;s seat, carried on the conflict most bitterly and with
divisive partisanship, their supporters carrying their quarrels to the point
of inflicting death and wounds. As Juventius was unable either to suppress
or abate these evils, he yielded to the violence and withdrew to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
suburbs. And in the struggle Damasus overcame, as his party was the
more determined of the two. It is admitted that in the basilica of Sicinus,
which is a place of assemblage for Christian worship, there were
found in one day one hundred and thirty-seven corpses of those who had
been done to death; and also that the excitement of the populace abated
slowly and with difficulty after the affair was over.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See how these Christians love one another!&rdquo; was a comment
made by pagans on the spirit which had prevailed in the earlier
Church. They now might have said it ironically. It is impossible
to acquit Damasus of all responsibility in the matter, as he
was a man of eminent ability and influence, and might have put
an end to these scenes of violence if he had exerted his authority.
It is equally impossible to believe that he took any part in them.
Then, as in the Reformation times, what John Knox calls &ldquo;the
raskill multitude&rdquo; greatly enjoyed an opportunity to show how
great their zeal for religion, in any other shape but that of obeying
its precepts. &ldquo;Set Jehu to pulling down idols,&rdquo; said an old
Puritan, &ldquo;and see how zealous he can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schism did not end with the bloody struggle around the
basilica of St. Sicinus. It is true that the civil authority now interposed
and banished the bishop of the Luciferian party. But he
afterward was allowed to return, and again the troubles revived
and ceased only with his second banishment. Even when the
Emperor Gratian gave Damasus the entire jurisdiction over the
bishops and priests involved in the schism, with a view to the final
suppression of these disputes, the extremists lingered on. After
Ursicinus there was yet another Luciferian bishop of Rome; and
by a curious freak of controversial zeal the memory of Felix was
consecrated as that of an opponent of Liberius, and a mythical
account of their relations was given currency, which has resulted
in the elevation of Felix to the rank of &ldquo;pope and martyr,&rdquo; on
the ground that Constantius had him beheaded for his loyalty to the Nicene
faith!<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Damasus made an excellent record in his see, after the abating
of the troubles which attended his accession to it. He left no
room for doubt as to his orthodoxy. For the first time since the
great controversy broke out in Alexandria, the whole weight and
influence of the great Roman see was thrown unreservedly and
effectively on the Athanasian side. The accession of Valentinian
(364-75) to the imperial authority in the West once more threw
the weight of court influence on the other side; but intolerance
was not carried to the same extent as by Constantius. At every
stage of the discussion we find Damasus outspoken on behalf of
the Nicene faith, and in support of Athanasius. In 368 he held
a synod at Rome, in which the Illyrian bishops Ursacius and
Valens, who were trying to Arianize the West, were condemned
as heretics; and in 370 another in which the same condemnation
was meted out to Auxentius, the Bishop of Milan. Before he
died he saw the second General Council meet at Constantinople
and lay the ban of the Church on all the compromises with
Arianism.</p>
<p>The see of Rome already had become a place of great splendor
and influence. &ldquo;Make me Bishop of Rome,&rdquo; the pagan senator
Praetextatus said to him, &ldquo;and I will be a Christian to-morrow.&rdquo;
Damasus seems to have enjoyed the pomp and show and opportunities
for outlay and for influence which his position secured
him. But there was much in his administration of his diocese
which commends him to our sympathies and even our admiration.
He seems to have been the first to have taken a genuine interest
in the Catacombs&mdash;the great underground burial-places which are
so rich in memorials of the Church&rsquo;s primitive and martyr ages.
He fostered their use as places of pilgrimage and reunion for the
people of his own diocese and pilgrims from others. He constructed
the staircases which made them accessible, the well-lights
for their illumination and ventilation, and the chapels for collective
worship. Here Christendom, in the day of its triumph,
gathered to commemorate those who had been faithful when the
Church was under the cross, and Prudentius in his <i>Peristephanon</i>
has left us a lively picture of the eager multitudes who resorted
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
thither on the festival days, some from Rome itself, others from
the Etrurian and Sabine villages, thronging even the great roads
to the city to their utmost capacity: &ldquo;From early morn they press
thither to greet the saints. The multitude comes and goes until
evening. They kiss the polished plates of silver which cover the
grave of the martyr. They offer incense, and tears of emotion
stream from the eyes of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, after long centuries of forgetfulness, the Catacombs were
reopened in 1578 by Antonio Bosio, traces of these pilgrimages
were found in the <i>graffiti</i> or rude chalk-inscriptions left on the
walls of the passages by the Italian peasants of the fourth and fifth
centuries. There also were found the inscriptions in verse, composed
by Damasus, and cut in stone by his friend, Furius Filocalus,
who devised an ornamental alphabet for the purpose. In
one of these Filocalus describes himself as one who &ldquo;reverenced
and loved Pope Damasus&rdquo; (<i>Damasi papae cultor atque amator</i>).</p>
<p>Another side of his activity has been brought into light by more
recent researches in Rome. Professor Lanciani says that to Damasus
belongs also the honor of having founded the first public library
of Christendom: &ldquo;The finest libraries of the first centuries of
Christendom were, of course, in Rome.... Such was the importance
attributed to books in those early days of our faith that, in
Christian basilicas, or places of worship, they were kept in the
place of honor&mdash;next to the episcopal chair. Many of the basilicas
which we discover from time to time, especially in the Campagna,
have the <i>apse trichora</i>&mdash;that is, divided into three small hemicycles.
The reason of this peculiar form was long sought in vain; but a
recent discovery made at Hispalis proves that of the three hemicycles
the central one contained the tribunal or episcopal chair,
the one on the right the sacred implements, the one on the left
the sacred books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first building erected in Rome, under the Christian rule,
for the study and preservation of books and documents, was the
<i>Archivum</i> (Archives) of Pope Damasus. This just and enterprising
pope, the last representative of good old Roman traditions as
regards the magnificence and usefulness of his public structures,
modelled his establishment on the pattern of the typical library at
Pergamos; of which the Palatine Library in Rome had been the
worthy rival. He began by raising in the centre a hall of basilical
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
type, which he dedicated to St. Lawrence,&rdquo; and which &ldquo;was surrounded
by a square portico, into which opened the rooms or cells
containing the various departments of the archives and of the
library.&rdquo; A commemorative inscription, composed by Damasus
himself, in hexameters, seven in number, was set in front of the
building above the main entrance. The text has been discovered
in a <span class="small">MS.</span> formerly at Heidelberg, now in the Vatican. The first
four hexameters do not bring out in a good light the poetical
faculties of the worthy pontiff&mdash;in fact their real meaning has not
yet been ascertained; but the last three verses are more intelligible:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Archibis, fateor, volui nova condere tecta;</p>
<p class="t0">Addere praeterea dextra laevaque columnas,</p>
<p class="t0">Quae Damasi teneant proprium per saecula nomen.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Around the apse of the inner hall there was another distich
of about the same poetical value, the text of which has been discovered
in a <span class="small">MS.</span> at Verdun:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Haec Damasi tibi, Christe Deus, nova tecta levavi</p>
<p class="t0">Laurenti saeptus martyris auxilio.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mention of Damasus&rsquo;s Archives is frequently made in the
documents of the fourth and fifth centuries. Jerome calls them <i>chartarium
ecclesiae Romanae</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>But a still more lasting monument of his fame is the Latin
Vulgate, which he incited Jerome&mdash;as the English-speaking world
calls Sophronius Eusebius Hieronymus&mdash;to prepare for the Church
of the West. From a very early time Latin translations of the
Scriptures from the Greek version of the Old Testament and the
Greek original of the New Testament had been in existence. But
although there were two well recognized types of these early versions&mdash;the
Italian and the African&mdash;there was so little uniformity
that there were &ldquo;almost as many versions as copies.&rdquo; Jerome
was a man of classical culture and a close student of the Scriptures,
which he could read in Hebrew as well as in Greek and Latin.
He came to Rome from Syria in 382, to ask the aid of Damasus
in behalf of the Luciferian schism at Antioch&mdash;a matter in which
the Bishop of Rome hardly could meddle. Even before his
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
arrival he had been in correspondence with Damasus and had
written for him an exposition of the vision of the Seraphim in
Isaiah 6. Damasus called a synod in which the schism at Antioch
was discussed, but no result reached. It is said that in this synod
he exhorted Jerome to take up the work of giving the Church a
good Latin version of the Bible. A ninth-century writer says he
put him in charge of the <i>Archivum</i>, or public library, described by
Professor Lanciani. Later writers speak of him, without much
warrant, as Damasus&rsquo;s secretary. It seems probable that Damasus
regarded him as a desirable man for the bishopric when his own
death should leave it vacant. But when his death came in 384,
the Dalmatian scholar was passed over, perhaps because he was
not a Roman, and a much smaller man than either Damasus or
Jerome was chosen instead. So Jerome went back to the East
and established himself at Bethlehem. Between 382 and 404 he
completed his version of the Scriptures, which is of especial
importance to the student of Latin hymnology, as it stands in much
the same relation to the Latin hymns of the fifth and later centuries
as does the English Bible to the English hymn-writers.
It controls their vocabulary and explains their allusions.</p>
<p>As a poet Damasus does not take very high rank. We have
seen Professor Lanciani&rsquo;s opinion of his inscriptions. Some forty
poems are attributed to him, but only a very few of these concern
us here. In the Cottonian <span class="small">MSS.</span> there is a copy of rhymed &ldquo;Verses
of Damasus to his Friend&rdquo; (<i>Versus Damasi ad Amicum suum</i>),
which would be interesting to us if we were sure that Sir Alexander
Croke is right in assuming that this is our Damasus. But the
name &ldquo;Rainalde&rdquo; in the first line would hardly occur in a Latin
poem by a Roman author of the fourth century.</p>
<p>There is no reason, however, to call in question the two hymns&mdash;one
to the Martyr Agatha and the other to the Apostle Andrew&mdash;which
are ascribed to him in the collections. And the former is
especially remarkable as being the oldest hymn in which rhyme is
employed intentionally and throughout. Of course if it were true that Hilary
wrote the <i>Jesu refulsit omnium</i> or the <i>Jesu quadrigenariae</i>,
which sometimes are printed as his, we should be obliged
to assign to him the honor thus claimed for Damasus. But the
preponderance of evidence and of presumption is against ascribing
these hymns to him. Koch assigns the latter to the fifth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
and not to the fourth. Mone ascribes the former to one of the
early Irish hymn-writers, whose name is lost to us. He finds in
it a tendency to alliterative construction, which indicates either
Celtic or Teutonic authorship; and he is decided for the former
by the mixture of Greek words, which was a favorite practice with
the Irish hymn writers. Also the metrical form is one affected by
them. On these grounds it is fair to claim that the hymn of
Damasus marks the introduction of end-rhymes into the Latin hymns.</p>
<p>Rhyme was by no means unknown in the poetry of the Greeks
and the Romans. But in languages which occupied that stage of
grammatical development in which the relations of words are expressed
by terminations, the resemblances in these were so numerous
and so constant that rhyme must have appeared rather a cheap
form for poetry. So in this stage we find the Southern Aryans of
Europe employing the quantity of syllables and those of Northern
Europe the coincidences of initial sounds (<i>stabreim</i> or alliteration)
and assonance in their verse. It was when the development of
languages substituted auxiliary and connecting words for terminations
that the coincidences of final sounds became so much a
source of pleasure to the ear as to justify their continuous employment
for that purpose.</p>
<p>But besides the occasional occurrence of rhyme in classic poetry&mdash;as
in Virgil&rsquo;s famous <i>jeu d&rsquo; esprit</i>,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sic vos non vobis edificatis aves,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>there seems to have existed forms of popular Latin verse in which
rhyme and accent held the place which quantity held in classic
poetry. It is this popular form of verse which the Church&rsquo;s hymns
began to reproduce, just as they also in many cases are written in
that <i>lingua rustica</i>, or countrified speech of the peasantry of Italy
and France, which was to become the basis of the Romance languages.
It is a matter of dispute whether the Saturnian verse-form,
to whose early prevalence and prolonged existence among
the classes not pervaded by Greek culture Horace alludes, was
based on an accentual scansion or merely on a numbering of
syllables and a rude approach to quantity. The general consensus
of scholars is that the Saturnian metres were based on accent, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
that rhyme, which is the natural and invariable product of the
accentual scansion, was also in use.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>So this hidden current of rhymed and accented poetry of the
common people rose to light again after many ages in the hymns
of the Western Church. Thus Damasus brings us to the parting
of the ways. In Hilary, Ambrose and his school, Prudentius,
Ennodius, Fortunatus, Elpis, Gregory, and Bede we have the perpetuation
of the classic tradition of quantitative verse in the service
of Christendom and for the ear of the cultivated classes. And
while that tradition expires in the Middle Ages, we see it revive
again in the sacred poets of the Renaissance&mdash;in Zacharius Ferrari,
George Fabricius, Marcus Antonius Muretus, Famiano Strada and
the other revisers of the Roman Breviary, the two Santeuls in the
Breviary of Clugny, and Charles Coffin in the Paris Breviary.
But Damasus stands at the head of a still more illustrious line.
Catching, perhaps, from the Etruscan and Sabine peasants, who
thronged the Catacombs on the day when the Martyr Agatha was
commemorated, the accents of the popular poetry, he became the
founder of the tradition which lives in the broader current of Latin
sacred song. In this line of succession we find already a few of
the Ambrosian hymns, and then a long series in which the two
Bernards, Adam of St. Victor, Thomas of Celano, Thomas
Aquinas, and Bonaventura are the most illustrious names. And
as indeed the tradition of accent and rhyme seems to have made
its way into the literature of the modern world through the Latin
hymns, Dante and all the great poets who have illustrated its
power to give pleasure might be said to belong here.</p>
<p>The hymn in commemoration of the Martyr Agatha&mdash;whose
story of suffering and triumph had seized on the imagination of
the people as did those of the martyrs Cecilia and Sebastian&mdash;we
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>

<p>It will be observed that Mr. Anketell, in the second line of the
sixth verse, follows the reading preferred by Daniel: <i>Pro miseris
supplica Domino</i>, which omits the Pope&rsquo;s name. But it seems
much more unlikely that this line should be altered to the line as
given above, than that the contrary change should have been
made. Emendators generally pass from the concrete to the vague,
from the specific to the general.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">AMBROSE.</span></h2>
<p>It would appear that the Ambrosian hymns obtained much of
their earliest recognition in Spain. At least so runs the statement
of Cardinal Thomasius, who edited the Mozarabic (Spanish) Breviary.
He says: &ldquo;It is not doubtful that in the seventh century
of the Church, when the Spanish Church especially flourished, the
Ambrosian hymns were everywhere in vogue.&rdquo; The <i>Concilium
Agathense</i> (Council of Agde in Southern France, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 506), which
concerned itself chiefly with matters of discipline, ordained that
hymns should be sung morning and evening, and at the conclusion
of matins, vespers, and masses. These and similar enactments
had reference to the body of hymns which had received the name
of the Bishop of Milan. Then, as now, they formed the true
fragrant cedar-heart of the old psalmody, and it is from their structure
that the Council of Toledo (633) drew its famous definition.
The Council said: &ldquo;<i>Proprie autem hymni sunt continentes laudem
Dei. Si ergo sit laus, et non sit Dei, non est hymnus. Si sit et
laus Dei laus</i> [<i>sic</i>] <i>et non cantatur non est hymnus. Si ergo laudem
Dei dicitur et cantatur, tunc est hymnus.</i>&rdquo; That is to say:
&ldquo;Hymns properly contain the praise of God. If therefore there
be praise, but not of God, this is no hymn. If there be praise,
praise of God, but not capable of being sung, this is no hymn.
If therefore the praise of God be both composed and sung, it is
then a hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author who is thus honored as the first great leader of the
Church&rsquo;s praise was born at Treves, in Gaul, about the year 340
(or, as some say, 334). His father was a Roman noble who
became praetorian prefect of the province of Gallia Narbonensis;
and as Hither Gaul was an important region, it can be easily seen
that the young Ambrose was reared in the midst of wealth and
power. His mother was a learned woman and he naturally imbibed
letters as he grew up. A tradition, which is probably based
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
on fact, assures us that even in his cradle he was marked for fame.
A swarm of bees came down upon him, and the amazed nurse
saw them clustered about his very mouth without harming him.
This was the same prodigy which had been related of Plato, and
hence his parents imagined a high destiny for the lad. It was indeed
a singular and suggestive commentary on his future life.
He preserved his equanimity amid a great deal of buzzing; and
the sweetness of his speech won to him no less a convert than the
great Augustine. His entire career was worthy of the sainted
Sotheria, his ancestress, who was martyred for the faith under
Diocletian.</p>
<p>He appears to us a man of both character and conscience. His
education was given him at Rome, and his brother Satyrus and
himself went to Milan to practice at the bar. His success as a
pleader was great. He became first assessor to the prefect with
the rank of <i>Consularis</i>, whose headquarters were now at Milan;
and subsequently he took charge of Liguria and Emilia. For in
369 we find him, by appointment of the Emperor Valentinian,
prefect of Upper Italy and Milan. His position is sometimes
styled that of &ldquo;consular,&rdquo; sometimes that of &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; and
sometimes that of &ldquo;praetor&rdquo; or imperial president, which last
perhaps the easiest designation for modern ears and carries the
plainest meaning with it.</p>
<p>Now Milan was the capital of Liguria and it was the business
of the praetor to preside in the stead of the Emperor over the
choice of a bishop. Auxentius, an Arian, who had held this
office, died in 374 and a new election was necessary. This was
not an easy matter, for the feud between the Catholics and the
Arians was at fever-heat, and rioting and bloodshed were very
certain to occur.</p>
<p>The praetor called to mind the advice of Probus, prefect of Italy,
who had once charged him to administer the affairs of his region
&ldquo;like a bishop.&rdquo; He therefore tried to cast oil upon the waters.
His genial gravity and calm serenity of spirit aided the impression
he meant to produce. Both factions gazed upon him with delight.
His attitude was so unpartisan as to charm everybody, and it was
very natural that this eloquent representative of the Emperor
should carry the suffrages of the throng. And just when the interest
was most intense and the confidence greatest, a child cried
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
out, &ldquo;Let Ambrose be bishop,&rdquo; and the crowd caught the contagion
at once.</p>
<p>In later days it was maliciously said that Ambrose had himself
contrived this scene with an eye to the stage effect&mdash;that for all his
apparent humility the coming bishop set store by the office and
wanted to obtain it&mdash;that, in short, his reluctance to receive it and
even his precipitate flight from the city were prearranged! More
than this, it has been asserted that the various schemes and subterfuges
to avoid becoming bishop were known to and abetted by his
friends, who were of the orthodox party and desired to have their
candidate elected. The best reply that can be given is the character
of the man himself. Such a person must have entertained
the highest reverence for such an office. In his administration of
its cares and duties he showed a conscious supremacy over every
worldly consideration. In his final acceptance of it he evinced no
less of self-denial than of sincerity. And it is incredible that so
mighty a mind as that of Augustine could have been caught by
the glittering emptiness of a hypocritical or self-seeking nature.
We may well charge these calumnies to their proper sources&mdash;those,
namely, of disappointed ambition or of envious malignity.</p>
<p>The record of this endeavor to escape office reads singularly
enough. He first put some criminals to the torture, hoping by
this means to shock the people through his hard-hearted justice.
When this would not do he avowed philosophic rather than Christian
sentiments. Having again failed, he welcomed some very
profligate persons&mdash;men and women&mdash;to his palace in a way to
invite scandal. This expedient being also detected he actually
escaped from the city by night, but lost his way and found himself
in front of the gates when morning dawned. This being his
fourth unavailing effort, he fled to a friend&rsquo;s house in the country,
begging that he might lie hidden there until the first rush of feeling
had been stemmed and he could hope for calmer consideration
of his refusal. But the friend immediately betrayed him for his
own good, and this well-meant treachery fastened the mitre firmly
on his brow. Basil the Great gloried in this new coadjutor; and at
the age of thirty-four or thereabouts, he himself became convinced
that he could struggle no longer against his fate.</p>
<p>It was thus that Ambrose finally assumed the episcopate, and it
was soon evident that this catechumen&mdash;for he had not even been
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
previously baptized&mdash;respected its dignities and meant that others
should be of the same mind as himself. He gave up his private
fortune, selling his large estates and personal property, and reserving
from them only a proper allowance to his sister Marcellina,
who had early taken the vow of virginity. He associated with this
proceeding the most strict method of living. &ldquo;He accepted no
invitations to banquets; took dinner only on Sunday, Saturday,
and the festivals of celebrated martyrs; devoted the greater part of
the night to prayer, to the hitherto necessarily neglected study of
the Scriptures and the Greek fathers and to theological writing;
preached every Sunday and often in the week; was accessible to
all, most accessible to the poor and needy; and administered his
spiritual oversight, particularly his instruction of catechumens,
with the greatest fidelity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the character, admirably condensed, of a model bishop.
To its fulfilment it requires the fervent piety of a true Christian
and the constant zeal of an acute student together with the large
prudence of a man of affairs. All these are abundantly found in
Ambrose. And if it happened that in other and worse times his
assertion of the spiritual independence of a bishop gave a foundation
for what became the authority of the pope, it may be properly
retorted that for him not to have done so then would have prevented
many another better thing in later ages.</p>
<p>He was a more polished scholar than Hilary, and a more devout
Christian than Damasus. Hence it was that his energy and skill
contributed largely to the success of the Nicene orthodoxy in the
West. Those times were troublous, and a cheerful and sunshiny
temper like that of Ambrose was a vast auxiliary to the cause. He
had been consecrated in 374, eight days after his election; and in
382 he presided at the synod in Aquileia which deposed Palladius
and Secundianus, the Arian bishops. By so doing, and by his
general attitude, he incurred the anger of Justina, whose son,
the younger Valentinian, he always upheld and shielded. The
Empress, however, determined to deal with him a good deal as
Ahab&rsquo;s wife dealt with Elijah. This comparison takes additional
point from the use which Ambrose himself made of the story of
Naboth in his defence of the Portian Church.</p>
<p>He had already encountered the smouldering idolatry of old
Rome, headed by the rhetorician, Symmachus; but the eloquence
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
of Ambrose had borne down all opposition and that conflict was
now at an end. A vindictive woman was, however, a greater
danger than a clever orator, and he found this true when Justina,
the Empress-mother, allied herself with the heretical Arians. His
pious zeal was kindled in a moment. Give up churches to such
a schismatic set as these? <i>Never!</i></p>
<p>It was at Easter in the year 386 that the Portian Church and
its holy vessels were demanded for the use of the other party.
Then stood up both the old Roman and the new Christian in the
single person of the Bishop of Milan. He compared the demand
to that of Ahab for Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard; and it may well be supposed
that with the rush of such a torrent of speech a current of
inference was also borne along which involved Justina herself.
The sermon, which has survived to us, was preached on Palm
Sunday, and in it he said that he would hold every religious edifice
against heresy to the very death. Let them take his property; let
them depose or destroy himself; let them do their worst&mdash;but for
his part he would stand there unshaken for the truth. He would
not incite riot and confusion, but he would not yield. It was the
anticipation of Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders!
Gott helfe mir!</i>&rdquo; For Ambrose proclaimed, almost in these
actual words, &ldquo;Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise. God help
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made one magnificent point in this discourse&mdash;the focal
centre it was of the entire outburst of eloquent declamation. It
was when he quoted what our Lord Himself had said. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
cries Ambrose, &ldquo;give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s, but give to God
what is God&rsquo;s. Is the Church the property of Caesar? Never!
It belongs unalterably to God. For God, then, it shall be kept.
It shall never be surrendered to Caesar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight was really a siege. The sacred character of the
churches protected their defenders. Ambrose invigorated the
multitude who flocked to help him, and who organized relief
parties to keep possession by day and by night. To relieve the
monotony of their watches, he frequently addressed them words
of encouragement. His fine equanimity triumphed over the impending
disaster. He taught the people there and then the hymns
of the early Church. He composed tunes and instructed them in
singing. And when at last he was able to discover the bodies of
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Gervasius and Protasius, the ancient martyrs, he kindled in the
spirits of his hearers such a fire that the popular voice was heeded
even by the throne itself, and Justina was defeated and gave up
the struggle. The court actually retreated before the authority of
the Church. And from that moment, and that other memorable
moment when he arraigned Theodosius, Ambrose delivered the
power of the bishop&rsquo;s crozier from any interference coming from
the Emperor&rsquo;s sceptre. Those were the days when the pastoral
staff might be of wood, but the man who wielded it was of pure gold.</p>
<p>This account needs the story of Theodosius to be immediately
attached to it in order to make it stand out in its true relation to
the character of Ambrose. The bishop met three great enemies
during his career. First appeared Idolatry, championed by
Symmachus; then followed Heresy, championed by Justina; and
now came Despotism, behind which stood the beloved Theodosius,
the Emperor-pupil, with his hands red from the massacre of Thessalonica.
The facts were these: a tumult had arisen in the circus
at that place; Botheric, an imperial officer, had been killed; and
the Emperor had in revenge put very many people to death. Some
have even run the figures up to the incredible altitude of thirty
thousand, and the massacre has been always regarded as involving
seven thousand victims at the lowest estimate. It was a brutal and
a horrible act, and Ambrose came out as Nathan did before David
and denounced it with the most withering reproaches. The
Emperor cowered and bent before this sirocco of the truth. The
speaker was poised so high above him in the assured calm of a
steady rectitude that Theodosius could do nothing except yield.
And yield he did; and for eight months he paid penance before
he was restored. It was the penance of the German Henry which
hastened the Reformation; it was the humiliation of Theodosius
which preserved both rights and dignities to the Church.</p>
<p>There is another side of Ambrose, and one on which Protestants
will love to dwell. While his great disciple Augustine lent the
weight of his authority to the doctrine that civil constraint might
be used to bring men to orthodox beliefs, Ambrose always denounced
that. When Valentinian II. sent him to Trier to negotiate
with the rebel Maximus, in the winter of 383-84, Ambrose&mdash;like
his contemporary, Martin of Tours&mdash;refused to have any
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
communion with the bishops who recognized Maximus as Emperor,
not on political grounds, but because they had obtained
the execution of certain Spanish Priscillianists for heresy. This
was the first blood-stain on the white garments of the Church&mdash;the
first in the long line of such sins against the Word and Spirit
of Christ. Yet Adrian VI. appealed to it as a precedent against
Luther, and described the usurper as one of &ldquo;the ancient and
pious emperors.&rdquo; In this he followed the example of his infallible
predecessor, Leo I., who, in 447, declared there would be
an end of all law, human and divine, if such heretics were allowed
to live!</p>
<p>As an orator and writer, Ambrose&rsquo;s strength lay in the simple
direct plunge of his sentences, wide and grand and forceful as the
launching of a great bowlder down a mountain path. And Mr.
Simcox has noticed that the words which are used to describe his
rhetorical power are almost all derived from <i>eloqui</i>. The other
assemblage of expressions, drawn from <i>disertus</i> and the like, refer
to the logical or learned weight of an argument. But what struck
every one in the case of Ambrose was that he let the truth come
mightily, just as he felt and believed it, with a swing and a vigor
which was the outburst of his own majestic soul. It was this
which won his victories. It was this power of sincerity which
made him the counsellor of Theodosius and the instructor of
Gratian as well as the guardian of Valentinian II. It was this
unshrinking forwardness of movement which led him to oppose the
rebuilding of the Jews&rsquo; synagogue; they had denied the Lord
Jesus&mdash;let their house burn! But a victory more Christian was
gained when thirty days of respite were fixed by his intercession
between the sentence and execution of criminals. And although
the defence of &ldquo;Virginity,&rdquo; as Ambrose conducted it, was the
mainspring of the conventual idea, and was afterward vigorously
used for that purpose, it is again plain that he advocated what he
believed and what he himself devoutly practised. He shines upon
us, from every angle of vision, as a character most pure, serene,
and brave.</p>
<p>The siege in the basilica at Milan had an important bearing on
the whole future of the Christian Church. Augustine tells us how
his mother Monica had followed him to Milan, and how when
there &ldquo;she hastened the more eagerly to the church and hung
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
upon the lips of Ambrose.&rdquo; (<i>Aug. Conf.</i>, B. vi.) &ldquo;That man,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;she loved as an angel of God because she knew
that by him I had been brought to that doubtful state of faith I
now was in.&rdquo; She evidently anticipated that so eloquent a
preacher would complete the work that he had been permitted to
begin. As for Augustine himself, he felt &ldquo;shut out both from
his ear and speech by multitudes of busy people whose weaknesses
he served.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How finely, by the way, this very expression illustrates the
greatness of Ambrose&rsquo;s character and the unselfishness of his life!
We get also a picture of the man as a student&mdash;one whose voice
would become worn by any extended public speaking, and who
therefore read to himself in his private studies in a manner unusual
apparently in that age&mdash;namely, as we do now, without opening
his lips or articulating the words. The effect of Justina&rsquo;s persecution
is also given most graphically. (<i>Aug. Conf.</i>, B. ix.) For
Augustine, having first told us how these heavenly voices fell upon
his ear, says that his mother &ldquo;bore a chief part of those anxieties
and watchings&rdquo; and &ldquo;lived for prayer.&rdquo; At this date, he emphatically
declares, &ldquo;it was first instituted that after the manner
of the Eastern churches, hymns and psalms should be sung lest
the people should wax faint through the tediousness of sorrow;
and from that day to this the custom is retained, divers (yea,
almost all) congregations throughout other parts of the world
following herein.&rdquo; It is he, moreover, who tells us that the two
martyrs&rsquo; bodies were transferred to that Ambrosian church erected
in 387, and where afterward were placed the bones of its great
founder; which was spared by Barbarossa in 1162, and which, as
the church of San Ambrogio, still occupies its old site in Milan.
Thus we have the most important of contemporary testimony to
some of these troublous scenes.</p>
<p>Of the Ambrosian hymns themselves a great deal may be said.
It is better to confine one&rsquo;s self rather, therefore, to results than to
the long processes which have led thither. But it is impossible to
agree with Dr. Neale and Archbishop Trench, who say of them
that &ldquo;there is a certain coldness in them&mdash;an aloofness of the
author from his subject.&rdquo; This is one of those bits of critical
misapprehension which lead us to doubt the infallibility of even so
admirable a judgment as that of the warden of Sackville College.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
The truth is that Dr. Neale admired gorgeousness and the splendor
of ritual. He praises the <i>Pange lingua</i> of Aquinas altogether too
much and he praises Ambrose altogether too little. A simple and
reverent spirit cannot be said to experience, as he does, a &ldquo;feeling
of disappointment&rdquo; before this which he calls &ldquo;an altar of
unhewn stone.&rdquo; This single phrase exposes the delusion.
&ldquo;<i>Unhewn</i> stone&rdquo; is not to Dr. Neale&rsquo;s nor to Archbishop Trench&rsquo;s
churchly taste, while it is precisely upon such an altar as that
(Ex. 20:25) that God was ready to let His flame descend. The
latest judgment&mdash;that of Mr. Simcox&mdash;(<i>Latin Literature</i>, vol. ii.,
405) is decidedly preferable: &ldquo;They all have the character of
deep, spontaneous feeling, flowing in a clear, rhythmical current,
and show a more genuine literary feeling than the prose works.&rdquo;
To any one who is at all familiar with the Ambrosian hymns this
will at once commend itself as the better criticism.</p>
<p>We may pause a moment to inquire about the chants which
bear his name, but we shall have slight enough information.
Four tunes are traditional: the Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and
Mixed Lydian. What these were and how they were sung, we do
not accurately know. We do know, however, that Ambrose employed
but four notes (the <i>tetrachord</i>) where we have subdivided
the various tones into the octave. The Germans do not profess
to tell us anything more definite than this.</p>
<p>The actual hymns are to be reckoned up in several ways. First
comes the mass of <i>Ambrosiani</i>, including hymns of Gregory the
Great and of other and much later authors. Many have been
foisted into this category because they were found in old breviaries
and manuscripts. Then from these we may separate the <i>presumed
originals</i>&mdash;of which a large proportion are now known to belong
to other writers. These misapprehensions are due to such compilers
as Fabricius, Cassander, Clichtove, and Thomasius, who
were not invariably correct and who perpetuated their designations
through later works. Still a third class are the <i>possible originals</i>,
selected by the judicious but not always accurate zeal of the Benedictines
of St. Maur when they edited the collected works of the
great bishop. And last of all can be placed the <i>probable originals</i>&mdash;those
hymns which are authenticated by Augustine and by St.
Caelestin (<span class="small">A.D.</span> 430), together with those in structure closely
resembling them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>For our own purposes a fifth class can even yet be formed from
the last named group&mdash;the <i>undoubted originals</i>, which will comprise
only those attested by contemporary authority.</p>
<p>The list would stand then in the order of authenticity, about as
follows:</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Attested by St Augustine.</dt>
<dd><i>Deus Creator omnium</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Aeterne rerum conditor</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Jam surgit hora tertia, Qua</i></dd>
<dt>Referred to directly by St. Caelestin.</dt>
<dd><i>Veni Redemptor gentium.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>These are the <i>undoubted</i> hymns and the only hymns to be safely
assigned to Ambrose.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>Aeterna Christi numera, et martyrum</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Illuminans altissimus</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Orabo mente dominum</i>,</dt>
<dd>(from <i>Bis ternas horas</i>,)</dd>
<dt><i>Splendor paternae gloriae</i>.</dt>
</dl>
<p>These are the <i>probable</i> hymns.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>Apostolorum passio</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Conditor alme siderum</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Consors paterni luminis</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Hic est dies verus Dei</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Jam lucis orto sidere</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Nunc sancte nobis Spiritus</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>O lux beata Trinitas</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Obduxere polum nubila coeli</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>O rex aeterne domine</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Rector potens, verax Deus</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Rerum Deus tenax vigor</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Somno refectis artubus</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Squalent arva soli pulvere multo</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Summae Deus clementiae</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Tristes erant apostoli</i>.</dt>
</dl>
<p>These have, for one reason or another, been assigned to Ambrose.
It is to be remembered that the <i>Tristes erant</i> is a part of
the <i>Aurora lucis rutilat</i>, and that in many cases the hymns are
very much intermingled. A rigid designation is therefore impossible.
The fourth class comprehends what may be called <i>Ambrosiani</i>&mdash;the
Sedulian and Gregorian and other hymns being simply
excluded from the list.</p>

<p>While these are often known to be mere paraphrases of Ambrose&rsquo;s
own homilies, or imitations of his hymns, they are as frequently
found to possess his spirit and almost the very forms of
his verse. Thus Daniel says of the <i>Ter hora trina</i> that it is &ldquo;not
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
unworthy of Ambrose himself.&rdquo; We also find many cases where
the Roman Breviary has altered the first line as well as changed
the arrangement of the stanzas.</p>
<p>The last class are those hymns, formerly called Ambrosian, but
now known to be the work of other hands. They are given with
their authors&rsquo; names appended.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have what may be called substantially the earliest
hymn-book of the Latin Church. Of course there were other
hymns which were very soon separated and properly assigned, but
not until the fifteenth century was any intelligent analysis attempted,
and it is even now&mdash;as can be easily seen&mdash;a matter not
of dogmatic certainty, but of scholarly authority and inherent
probability. It may not be improper to add, however, that in
these hymns we find some of the purest and most pious of praises.
The <i>honor</i> of the Virgin Mother and of the saints has not yet been
attempted. The martyrs, Stephen and Agnes and Agatha, are alone
mentioned, if we except an occasional and somewhat doubtful
tribute to others. These are hymns of worship and of prayer&mdash;of
adoration and of fellowship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>As a handful of grain from a great granary, here are four versions
of hymns counted as among Ambrose&rsquo;s best:</p>

<p>The closing scenes in the life of the great bishop were such as
became his past. His funeral address over his brother Satyrus is
like that of Bernard over his brother Gerard, or like that of Melanchthon
above the dead Luther. His eulogy of Theodosius, whom he
survived but two years, is conceived in a strain of lofty poetry,
several paragraphs opening with the repeated phrase <i>Dilexi virum illum.</i>
I loved that man!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Ambrose died on the night after Good Friday, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 397. Paulinus,
his biographer, was taking notes of the commentary pronounced
by his dying master on the 43d psalm. It was a scene
like that at the deathbed of the Venerable Bede. The failing bishop
said that he heard angelic voices and saw the smiling face of
Christ; and the reverent scribe avows that the face which looked
on his own was bright, and that around that aged head shone until
the very last an aureole of glory.</p>
<p>Let us allow much charity to the miracles and to the superstition
of that time, but let us also remember the gravity and sweetness
of the poet-bishop. For it is no wonder that when he lay in
state in the great cathedral with quiet, upturned face, little children
were moved by his gentle dignity of countenance and men
and women, affected by this holy presence, put away their sins,
and were baptized as followers of the dead man&rsquo;s faith.</p>

<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">PRUDENTIUS THE FIRST CHRISTIAN POET.</span></h2>
<p>Aurelius Prudentius Clemens has received rather more than
his due share of renown. His works have been edited by the
most careful scholars. There is a beautiful little &ldquo;Elzevir&rdquo; upon
which Heinsius expended his labor and which was printed at
Amsterdam in 1667. There is an &ldquo;Aldine,&rdquo; 4to, Venice, 1501.
But the most elegant is that of Parma (1788, 2 vols., 4to), edited
by Teoli; and the best is regarded as that of Faustinus Arevalus,
the Spaniard, Rome 1788-89, also in 2 vols. 4to. If to these we add
the most <i>accessible</i> collection of his writings, we shall find it in the
fifty-ninth and sixtieth volumes of Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia</i>. The text
of these various editions is derived from what is called the Codex
Puteanus, now in the Paris Library&mdash;a manuscript dating into the
fifth or sixth century. In all, there have been nearly a dozen of
them, of which that of R. Langius (1490, 4to) is the true <i>princeps</i>&mdash;the
very earliest. And in the matter of editorship, it is worthy
of note that Erasmus did not disdain to expend his fine classical
skill upon the hymns for Christmas and the Epiphany.</p>
<p>If we ask Bentley his opinion of Prudentius he tells us that he is
&ldquo;the Horace and Virgil of the Christians.&rdquo; Milman declares that
he was &ldquo;the great popular author of the Middle Ages,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;no work but the Bible appears with so many glosses [commentaries]
in High German.&rdquo; &ldquo;T. D.,&rdquo; away back in 1821, when
dear old Kit North was editing <i>Blackwood</i>, furnished that periodical
with some poetical translations and remarked that Prudentius
was &ldquo;the Latin Dr. Watts.&rdquo; In La Rousse he obtains the credit
of being &ldquo;the first Christian poet.&rdquo; Among the earlier contemporaneous,
or slightly subsequent references his name is preceded
by the magic letters, &ldquo;V. C.,&rdquo; standing not, as some have thought,
for <i>Vir Consularis</i>, a man who had enjoyed the consulship, but for
<i>Vir Clarissimus</i>, a person of high distinction. It is reserved for
the &ldquo;worthy and impartial&rdquo; Du Pin to formulate a judgment
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
more in accord with the true facts of the case. &ldquo;Prudentius,&rdquo;
saith Du Pin, &ldquo;is no very good poet, he often useth expressions
not reconcilable to the purity of Augustus&rsquo;s Age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The value of his poetry turns largely upon its theological and
historical merits&mdash;both of which are considerable. It is not structurally
perfect by any means, and yet it has furnished several very
lovely hymns to the Church&mdash;graceful and delicate, rather than
strong or inspiring.</p>
<p>In giving him his name it is safe to take that which is usually
adopted: <i>Aurelius Prudentius</i>, surnamed <i>Clemens</i> or the Merciful.
To this has occasionally been prefixed <i>Quintus</i> or <i>Marcus</i>, but
neither has sufficient authority in its favor. He was a Spaniard,
and the main facts concerning his life are learned from his own
metrical preface to his poems. Probably few questions have been
more closely discussed by the learned than this of his birthplace.
The internal evidence is heaped up on either side until it is seen
that Calahorra [Calagurris] is probably where he was born, while
Saragossa [Caesarea-Augusta] was &ldquo;his city&rdquo; and the place with
which he was most identified.</p>
<p>He was doubtless of good family. Those industrious and
microscopic editors who have devoted themselves to his fame have
laid great stress upon the names <i>Aurelius</i> and <i>Clemens</i>. The
<i>Aurelii</i>, they say, were distinguished and well-born people. The
<i>Clementes</i> were also of notable memory. And there were two
<i>Prudentii</i> beside himself who obtained rather more than ordinary
distinction. Indeed, there were some five <i>Prudentii</i>, early and
late, and one of them, <i>Prudentius Amoenus</i>, tried, indifferently
badly, to climb to fame by an abridgment of his predecessor&rsquo;s
history of the Old and New Testaments. In this he was so successful
that the original is now lost, the condensation alone remains,
and our Prudentius is often known as <i>Prudentius Major</i>, to
differentiate him from this troublesome <i>Minor</i>, who was a preceptor
of Walafrid Strabo. In regard to two other hymns&mdash;the <i>Corde
natus</i> and the <i>Vidit anguis</i>&mdash;an element of doubt has been introduced
by this same person. Faustinus Arevalus was nothing if
not a hymn-tinker (see <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, vol. xlvi., p. 125
<i>ff.</i>), and it is possible that these by such careless editorship have
been incorporated into the text of the true Prudentius from the
pages of his namesake and imitator. The hymn <i>Virgo Dei genitrix</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
(of the fifteenth century) is ascribed to another of the five
Prudentii.</p>
<p>This sort of blunder is by no means unusual. We have an instance
in point with reference to the very Consul Salia in whose
consulship our poet tells us that he was born. A similarity between
<i>Coss. Salia</i> and <i>Massalia</i> misled the learned. They saw in
this a proof that Massilia (Marseilles) was his birthplace, and
Prudentius was at once claimed for France. But we have now
unravelled and disentangled the greater part of this obscure coil.
Flavius Philippus and Flavius <i>Salia</i> are known to have served conjointly
in the year 348, and hence the industry of Aldus Manutius
and Labbeus (Labb&egrave;e) has been thrown away and their false conjecture
has been abandoned.</p>
<p>Prudentius himself tells us nothing about his family, beyond
what we derive by inference. The deeper that we plunge into
this labyrinth of guesses the further we are from being settled in
opinion. The exhaustive&mdash;and, let us add, the exhausting&mdash;editor
of the latest edition finally calls a halt in the middle of his complicated
Latin sentences and avows himself utterly at a loss about the
truth. There is then some comfort left to us in cutting and untying
these knots; for whatever view we may advance has found
distinguished and earnest championship already! On the whole,
Teoli appears a reliable leader, and him we have mostly followed,
as later authors, such as Professors Fiske and Teuffel, seem to
have done before us.</p>
<p>Let us say, then, that he was born in 348, Philippus and Salia
being consuls, at Calahorra, which lies up the Ebro and to the
northwest of Saragossa. To-day Calahorra is a small place of a
few thousand inhabitants, but it furnishes two other notable facts
to history in addition to its claim to be the birthplace of Prudentius.
It was this little fighting town which resisted Afranius, whom
Pompey sent to take it in 78 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and it was then that the citizens
ate their wives and children sooner than surrender. Besides this
somewhat doubtful glory it produced Quinctilian; while Tudela,
which is between it and Saragossa, gave a name to the learned
Jew, Benjamin of Tudela, whose ideas about the Tower of Babel
have become as classic as Prudentius&rsquo;s hymns or as the Maid of
Saragossa herself. It may be added that paganism was very early
abandoned in all this region.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The parents of Prudentius gave him a good education. He
possessed, says Teoli, <i>ingenium acre, disertum, ferax</i>&mdash;talent that
was keen, eloquent, and fruitful. But at the rhetoricians&rsquo; schools,
which he attended about the age of seventeen, he found little that
was commendable in manners or morals. It would appear that
he gave the rein to his vices and that his life was not very rapidly
turned into the ways of Christianity.</p>
<p>He was at first called to the bar and made judge in two towns
of considerable size, which may perhaps have been Toledo and
Cordova. About the year 400 he is supposed to have gone to
Rome and to have been favorably received by Honorius the Emperor,
who then promoted him to some sort of honorable office in
his native country. At fifty-seven years of age, as he himself tells
us, he began to cultivate literature. He had retired from active
life, much as Chaucer did in later days. From this period onward
he lived in quiet; he &ldquo;fled fro&rsquo; the presse and dwelt in soothfastnesse,&rdquo;
like the father of English verse. He gave himself to
sacred things&mdash;to hymns in honor of God and of the saints, and
to poems against paganism and in favor of Christian duty.</p>
<p>His poems have Greek titles. First comes the <i>Psychomachia</i>
(the Battles of the Soul)&mdash;in hexameter&mdash;treating of the conflict
in a Christian soul between virtue and vice. The contrasts are
arranged somewhat like those of Plutarch between the Greek and
Roman leaders, only, of course, the antithesis is decidedly against
the vices. Here stand Faith opposed to Idolatry, and Chastity
facing Impurity, and Patience resisting Anger, and Humility contrasted
with Pride, and Sobriety pre-eminent over Excess, and
Liberality vanquishing Covetousness, and Concord healing the
wounds caused by Dissension. There are nine hundred and
fifteen lines in the poem.</p>
<p>The <i>Peristephanon</i> (Concerning Crowns) has twelve hymns in
honor of various martyrs. Mr. Simcox notes that these are
almost idyllic in form, and that there is much made of the white
dove which flies from the burning pile about St. Eulalia and of
the violets which the girls should bring to the tombs of the virgin
martyrs. It may be interesting to name the martyrs thus celebrated.
There were two from Calahorra; then Laurentius and
Eulalia; eighteen who suffered at Saragossa; Vincentius, and
finally Fructuosus and Quirinus, bishops both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Then comes a poem on the Baptistery at Calahorra (translated
in <i>Blackwood</i>, vol. ix., p. 192), with a description of the deaths of
Cassian, Romanus, Hippolytus, Peter and Paul the apostles,
Cyprian and Agnes. These poems, it should be said, are various
in metre and some are quite long.</p>
<p>The <i>Cathemerinon</i> (a Book of Hours) is the real mine whence
the most of the hymns which were composed by Prudentius are
taken. In this we have hymns for cock-crowing and morning;
before and after food; at the lighting of the lamp; and before retiring
to rest. With these are joined others for the use of those who
are fasting, and at the conclusion of the fast; for all hours and at
the burial of the dead; the work ending with hymns for Christmas
and Epiphany.</p>
<p>The <i>Apotheosis</i> consists of poems relating to the errors of all the
heretics that can be named&mdash;Patripassians, Arians, Sabellians,
Manichaeans, Docetae, etc. The value of this to ecclesiastical history
is easily perceived. It has more than a thousand hexameters
and it treats additionally of the nature of the soul and of sin and
of the resurrection.</p>
<p>The <i>Hamartigenia</i> (the Origin of Evil) takes up original sin as
against Marcion; and the <i>Dittochaeon</i> (which possibly means
Double Food) is the abridgment of Old and New Testaments.
This last is a sort of religious picture gallery ranging
from Adam to the Apocalypse in hexametrical epigrams. There
is reason to doubt whether it be what Prudentius originally composed.
If he followed his usual vein of abundant verse, there is
no question but that these half a hundred epigrams would be
more popular than his very extensive poetical treatment of such
subjects.</p>
<p>It is left us to mention the two books against Symmachus, the
Roman senator, whom Ambrose so earnestly and successfully opposed.
Symmachus had purposed to restore the idols, revive the
revenues of the pagan temples, and generally to cast out Christianity
from Rome. The poetry of Prudentius is again valuable
here, for it plunges into the origin and baseness of idolatry, describing
the conversion of Rome, and presenting a picture of the
times which is invaluable to the historian. It is from the pages
of Prudentius that we learn the cruelty of the purest of the Roman
women, when</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The modest vestal, with her down-turned thumb</p>
<p class="t0">Urges the gladiator to his stroke</p>
<p class="t0">Lest life may lurk in any vital place!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One line in our author&rsquo;s hymn in honor of St. Lawrence preserves
an historical fact which was not appreciated in its full
significance until our own times. He says, <i>Aedemque Laurenti
tuam Vestalis intrat Claudia</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Claudia, the Vestal Virgin, enters
Thy House.&rdquo; In 1883 there was discovered in the <i>Atrium</i> of
the Vestals a pedestal of a statue dedicated to one of the heads of
the order, from which her name had been effaced purposely.
Nothing of it was left except the initial C., while there still
remained the praise of &ldquo;her chastity and her profound knowledge
in religious matters&rdquo; (<i>Ob meritvm Castitatis Pvdicitiae adq. in
Sacris Religionibusqve Doctrinae Mirabilis</i>). The statue was
erected in the year 364, and the order was abolished by the
younger Theodosius in 394, so that her conversion must have
taken place between those two dates. The conversion of a person
filling a place of such high honor in pagan eyes, of a <i>Vestalis
maxima</i>, must have been a severe blow to the pagan party, which
in Rome was making a fierce but hopeless fight for the old worship.
Yet we find no other reference to it in literature, unless
the letter of Symmachus to a Vestal, of whom he had heard that
she meant to withdraw from her order, was addressed to Claudia.
See Professor Lanciani&rsquo;s <i>Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent
Discoveries</i>, pp. 170-72 (Boston, 1888).</p>
<p>It is uncertain in what year or in what part of Spain Prudentius
died. Conjecture varies between 410 and 424 <span class="small">A.D.</span> This infinitude
of filmy particulars causes one to feel as if he were walking
through spider-webs of a morning in the country. This hard,
practical nineteenth century only experiences a sense of annoyance
as it encounters the elaborate nothings of that strangely laborious,
all-gathering scholarship which prevailed in the sixteenth and
seventeenth. To create any intensity of interest to-day requires
an imagination which would sacrifice truth to attractiveness.</p>
<p>But certainly, from what we can see of the man in his works,
we can have no hesitation in pronouncing a verdict highly favorable
both to his poetry and his piety. As governor of important
towns he merited&mdash;or he would scarcely have received&mdash;his title
of &ldquo;the Merciful.&rdquo; As a close observer of his time and a student
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
of its thought, he has preserved for us what we cannot spare. It
is he who in the <i>Jam moesta quiesce querela</i> struck the first notes
which were to vibrate in the <i>Dies irae</i>. It is he again who in the
<i>Ales die nuntius</i> anticipated Henry Vaughan and his</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Father of lights, what sunny seed,</p>
<p class="t0">What glance of day hast thou confined</p>
<p class="t0">Into this bird!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The hymn is as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The bird, the messenger of day,</p>
<p class="t">Cries the approaching light;</p>
<p class="t0">And thus doth Christ, who calleth us</p>
<p class="t">Our minds to life excite.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Bear off, he cries, these beds of ease</p>
<p class="t">Where lie the sick and dumb;</p>
<p class="t0">And let the chaste and pure and true</p>
<p class="t">Watch, for I quickly come.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We haste to Jesus at his word,</p>
<p class="t">Earnest to pray and weep,</p>
<p class="t0">Such fervent supplication still</p>
<p class="t">Forbids pure hearts to sleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Disturb our dream, thou holy Christ,</p>
<p class="t">Break off the night&rsquo;s dark chain;</p>
<p class="t0">Forgive us all our sin of old,</p>
<p class="t">And grant us light again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And so it is still he who casts the ray of his fancy upon Bethlehem
and upon the Transfigured Christ. Here is the <i>Quicumque
Christum quaeritis</i> in proof of his real genius:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O ye who seek your Lord to-day,</p>
<p class="t">Lift up your eyes on high,</p>
<p class="t0">And view him there, as now ye may,</p>
<p class="t">Whose brightness cannot die.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How gloriously it shineth on</p>
<p class="t">As though it knew no dearth:</p>
<p class="t0">Sublime and lofty, never done,</p>
<p class="t">Older than heaven and earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou art the very King of men,</p>
<p class="t">Thy people Israel&rsquo;s King,</p>
<p class="t0">Promised unto our fathers when</p>
<p class="t">From Abraham all should spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To thee the prophets testified,</p>
<p class="t">In thee their hearts rejoice&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Our Father bids us seek thy side</p>
<p class="t">To hear and heed thy voice.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>I have changed the two last stanzas into the second person instead
of the third. Otherwise the rendering is a faithful and literal
version of the hymn. This, then, is a good proof of the genuine
ring of true metal to be found in Prudentius.</p>
<p>The variety and flexibility of his measures, in spite of archaic
or post-classical words and phrases, deserves our highest praise.
He is a writer of the &ldquo;Brazen Age,&rdquo; but he has not sunk far from
the &ldquo;Silver,&rdquo; nor exactly into the falchion sweep of the more
brutal &ldquo;Iron&rdquo; time.</p>
<p>Here is another of his hymns, the <i>Nox et tenebrae et nubila</i>,
which has obtained a place in the Roman Breviary:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Night, clouds and darkness, get you gone!</p>
<p class="t">Depart, confusions of the earth!</p>
<p class="t0">Light comes; the sky so dark and wan</p>
<p class="t">Brightens&mdash;it is the Saviour&rsquo;s birth!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The gloom of earth is cleft in twain</p>
<p class="t">Struck by that sudden, solar ray;</p>
<p class="t0">Color and life return again</p>
<p class="t">Before the shining face of day.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thee, Christ, alone we seek to know,</p>
<p class="t">Thee, pure in mind, and plain in speech;</p>
<p class="t0">We seek thee in our worship, so</p>
<p class="t">That thou canst through our senses teach.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How many are the dreams of dread</p>
<p class="t">Which by thy light are swept apart!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou, Saviour of the sainted dead,</p>
<p class="t">Shine with calm lustre in the heart!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The same leading idea of the analogy of the natural light with
the spiritual runs through the following:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lo the golden light appears,</p>
<p class="t">Lo the darkness pales away</p>
<p class="t0">Which has plunged us long in fears,</p>
<p class="t">Wandering in a devious way.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now the light brings peace at last,</p>
<p class="t">Holds us purely as its own;</p>
<p class="t0">All our doubts aside are cast,</p>
<p class="t">And we speak with holy tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;So may all the day run on</p>
<p class="t">Free from sin of hand or tongue,</p>
<p class="t0">And our very glances shun</p>
<p class="t">Every form and shape of wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;High above us One is set</p>
<p class="t">All our days to know and mark,</p>
<p class="t0">And our acts he watches yet</p>
<p class="t">From the dawning to the dark.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Prudentius undoubtedly exhibits the early traces of observances
which are peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church. In one of his
hymns (the <i>Cultor Dei memento</i>) he advises that the sign of the
cross be made upon the forehead and above the heart:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Frontem locumque cordis</p>
<p class="t0">Crucis figura signet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But we have not the space, nor is this the proper occasion, to
follow him through those matters which belong to the church historian
more than to the hymnologist. We must leave him to end
his days in undisturbed quiet, a good deal after the manner of
Chaucer, as indeed we have already hinted. He is said to have
died in the neighborhood of the year 405 in Spain. Our information
is largely conjectural and affords us no certainty about his
closing years.</p>
<p>That a poet who still dwelt amid the sculptured coldness of
the pagan past should have written such hymns, is a proof of what
Christianity was then achieving. She had banished from the chilly
apartments of literature the ancient <i>focus</i> with its feeble charcoal
and its mephitic smoke. Instead of this she had created the
cheerful <i>hearth</i>, on which a pure fire of devotion was kindled and
whose ascending flame swept off the immoral vapors of the time.
Prudentius, in a word, made scholarship and religion companions
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
instead of enemies; and brightened classic prosody by the presence
of a living faith.</p>
<p>To Prudentius also more hymns have been ascribed than he
ever wrote, but after these have been weeded out, there are left:</p>

<br /><span class="small">ENNODIUS, BISHOP OF PAVIA.</span></h2>
<p>Rambach says, in his Anthology, that none of the hymns of
Ennodius have been adopted by the Church. &ldquo;Nor have I,&rdquo;
adds Daniel, &ldquo;found in any breviary a verse of Ennodius. Yet,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;since there are many of them in the collection of
Thomasius, which have been taken from the Mozarabic Breviary,
it seems to me certain that in some countries they were formerly
employed by the Church.&rdquo; Some corruption has also taken
place in the text. And, in short, these hymns have never appeared
either devout or original enough to secure the suffrages
of the faithful.</p>
<p>The reason for their emptiness is not far to seek. Their author
was a man of great celebrity but of little piety. His reputation,
too, is that of an ardent ecclesiast, who managed to climb the
heights of saintship by working in the interest of the Roman pontiff.
He labored to maintain the supremacy of the Pope&mdash;upon
whom, it is said, on good authority, that he was the first to bestow
the world-wide appellation of Papa (Pope)&mdash;and to effect the
union under this one religious head of both Greek and Roman
churches. To this single cause, with its double aspect, Ennodius
gave his talents and his zeal. He was so far successful that he
gained honor and position for himself, however he was prospered
in his other plans.</p>
<p>He was a person of sufficient prominence for Italy and Gaul to
contest the honor of his birth. It would appear, however, that
Gaul has the best title to whatever credit his nationality may give.
The works on hymnology do not mention him, and the only
notices of his life and writings are to be found in out-of-the-way
corners of books on Latin literature and in the controversial pages
of Church historians. Those who attack and those who defend
the papal claims, are in the habit of mentioning the two embassies
of Ennodius as notable points in their argument; but the man is
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
lost from sight in the paramount importance of his mission. It
cannot be so with us, to whom his personal character is the topic
of interest, and who care only for his circumstances as these
develop him to us upon his hymnologic side.</p>
<p>Ennodius has himself informed us that he regarded Arles as his
native place. We also know that he was born in 473, because he
died in 521 at the age of forty-eight. His family was highly respectable,
if, indeed, it was not actually illustrious. Our poet always
shows a familiarity with the affairs of good society; and in those
times good society had only one meaning. It was a society which
educated its scions in the polite learning of Greece and Rome, and
which made much of the ability to speak and write the Latin
tongue. It is scarcely to be questioned that this was the theory
on which the early education of Ennodius proceeded. He was
sent to Milan in order to become versed in what was called
humane learning. If he is himself to be believed he acquired
both bad and good in this school. He laments with a mock
humility (for so it would appear by his later literary derelictions)
that he had obtained a great deal of wicked and ungodly information;
and really no one can read some of his nasty epigrams and
doubt his assertion. For, whether it was permissible to a saint
or not, it is a fact, that the editors of his works have not scrupled
to print some exceedingly profane and improper pieces which are
undoubtedly the product of his pen.</p>
<p>His aunt, who was bearing the cost of this admirable instruction,
died in 489&mdash;that is, when he was sixteen&mdash;and he was left without
means to proceed with his studies. He avows that he had come
to detest the very name of liberal education, and this, under the
circumstances, cannot well be regarded as anything very surprising.
We soon after find him married to a lady who is described
as of a &ldquo;most noble&rdquo; and therefore highly appropriate family.
She was, moreover, &ldquo;very rich&rdquo;&mdash;another satisfactory point. With
this wealthy and fashionable wife, Ennodius rapidly obtained a
view of earth, and what earth can give, which was so far limited in
that the money did not equal the desires of the married pair. It
ran low and the bitterness of financial perplexities mingled with
the cup of their happiness. Judging the husband by his epigrams
he was pretty fairly exhausted by the speed of their career, and
was quite ready to shake off the encumbrance of a family and devote
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
himself to the lofty purpose of being supported by somebody
else. An unprejudiced mind fails to see in this any particular
&ldquo;admonition&rdquo; or &ldquo;example&rdquo; to his age. It is merely the selfish
escape of a worldly but embarrassed man. Divorces were not
available then with the ease with which a less scrupulous and
more intellectual generation can now procure them. The proper,
and, indeed, the meritorious way, was to slip into a cloister and
become one of that vast army which was soon to be the tower of
strength of the Pope. He himself ascribes this step to a serious
illness in which he had been healed through the miraculous interposition
of St. Victor, after the doctors had given up his case.</p>
<p>Ennodius now attached himself to the person and fortunes of
Epiphanius, the Bishop of Pavia. He was placed under the tutelage
of one Servilio, who taught him theology according to the
methods and opinions then in vogue. His wife meanwhile had
made the best of it after the same fashion, and had gone into a
convent, where all trace of her vanishes in that monotone of gray
walls, chanted services, and ceaseless devotion. At least no individuality
resembling her ever henceforth emerges from that uniform
procession which passes by us, in this and later centuries,
as the long line of hooded figures moves athwart Dante and
Virgil in the &ldquo;Purgatorio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the career of Ennodius now begins. He is the bishop&rsquo;s
chosen companion, the associate of his expedition to Brian&ccedil;on in
Burgundy in behalf of certain prisoners; for in those days the
spiritual hand was often laid with a mighty grip on the secular
arm. The poet was by this time a deacon, having been ordained
thereto by his kind friend the bishop. And the duties of this
private secretaryship were so pleasant that it is evident no one
would willingly surrender them for a cold cell and matins early in
the morning. The glimpses which we get of Ennodius do not
encourage us to esteem him an ascetic, or to think him lacking in
zeal for personal comfort. He was the literary adjunct of a remarkably
amiable prelate, with whom he was on terms of intimacy
which made his own life no care at all, and his meat and drink no
problem whatever! From 494, then, he continued still to occupy
this post of trust and ease. We are told that the bishop persuaded
him to it, but there can be no reasonable objection to our believing
that the bishop had no unwilling listener.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The literary capacity of Ennodius next attracts attention. His
patron (who must not be confused with the great Bishop of Salamis,
the author of the famous <i>Heresies</i>, who belongs to the previous
century) died before 510. Maximus III. had succeeded
Epiphanius, and after his death our Ennodius, in 510 or 511, was
selected for the vacant diocese. The name of this episcopate was
Ticinum, or, as we now style it, Pavia. It is plain that the bestowal
of this dignity was hastened by the fact that our scholar
while still a deacon had defended Pope Symmachus before the
Roman synod called &ldquo;Palmare,&rdquo; and so effectually that the discourse
was entered on the acts of the council, where it still appears.
The Pope had been charged with crimes, and a synod convoked by
the heretical Theodoric was to decide the case. The date was
October, 501. The place was a portico of the church of St. Peter
at Rome to which this name of Palmare was usually given. And
the speech is historic inasmuch as it is the earliest recorded instance
of that assertion of supremacy on the part of the Roman pontiff
which frees him from any responsibility to earthly rulers. Ennodius
thus became the advocate of this dogma, and upon the broad
wings of papal favor he soared to the high station which his patron
Epiphanius had quitted.</p>
<p>This burst of declamatory eloquence did not come without preparatory
training. Ennodius had been exercised in the art of
declamation in his youthful days and, as a deacon, he was able to
utilize his knowledge. In 510 or 511, not long after his elevation
to the mitre, he wrote the life of his friend and predecessor. And
this he followed with divers performances of a literary character
which were generously applauded. He became a sort of hero in
the world of letters, and whatever he was pleased to compose was
heartily commended.</p>
<p>In 515 it was natural that such an advocate of the absolute
domination of the Roman pontiff should be selected to help in the
effort to reunite the Eastern Church to the Western. The ambassadors
were himself, the Bishop of Pavia; Fortunatus, Bishop
of Catania; Venantius, a presbyter; Vitalis, a deacon, and
Hilarius, a notary and scribe. These names themselves reveal a
not infrequent source of confusion to students of that distressingly
barren period, when it was regarded as a very pleasant compliment
to call the son of a nobody by the distinguished appellation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
some great person in the Church. In this manner Hilary and
Fortunatus suffered then, and modern scholars have been often
vexed and perplexed since, especially when dates come near
together. It hardly needs to be added that these wearers of illustrious
names have only that meed of renown, such as it is.</p>
<p>The purpose of the embassy was to obtain from the Byzantine
Emperor Anastasius, at that time a man of great age, the recognition
of Hormisdas, the ruling Pope, as the supreme religious
head of both empires. It was a delicate negotiation, and it demanded
a perfectly incorruptible adherence to the interests of
Rome. In this respect Ennodius stood pre-eminent as what
Mosheim styles an &ldquo;infatuated adulator of the Roman pontiff,&rdquo;
and as a master of the style then required in a diplomat. He had
(in 503) eulogized Pope Symmachus, calling him &ldquo;one who
judged in the place of God&rdquo; (<i>vice Dei judicare</i>) and again (in
507) he had published a panegyric on Theodoric, the Gothic King
of Italy, which had all the absurd flattery of that species of composition.
To crown these he was the obedient occupant of the
see of Pavia. He was therefore just the man to do the work of
the relentless and uncompromising Pope.</p>
<p>Caelius Hormisdas was a man who never yielded, never forgot,
and never relaxed a purpose. Such men, backed by a sufficient
power, wring from a reluctant world about all that they have determined
to secure. But to the obstinate will of the Pope was opposed
the no less obstinate will of the old Emperor&mdash;now fully
eighty-five years of age&mdash;and quite as grim in his methods as any
Hormisdas. It was to be a battle of giants and the intermediates
might look for little favor. The opportunity for the negotiation
itself happened to occur in an unusual way. Vitalianus, commander
of the Imperial Byzantine cavalry, had taken arms against
the Emperor; had defeated and put to death Cyril, the opposing
general, and had then marched to the very gates of Constantinople.
The victor was proposing to color his rebellion by a pleasant pretext
of helping the orthodox; and the old Emperor, therefore,
turned the edge of his own humiliation by agreeing to a correspondence
with the Pope.</p>
<p>Anastasius began to carry out his share of this unpleasant business
by appointing a council to meet at Heraclea, in Thrace, on
July 15th, 515, and asking for commissioners to be sent from
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
Rome. The venerable fox knew perfectly well that he had not
allowed time enough for the proper instruction of these delegates,
nor for them to make the long journey. But Pope Hormisdas
appointed them, and they proceeded to the imperial court, utterly
indifferent as to the time of the council, and without any apologies
for their delay which history deigns to record. They went, indeed,
in a very haughty spirit, and did not even commence their
expedition before August 12th.</p>
<p>When they reached the Emperor they asked, or rather demanded,
that he should assent to the letter of Pope Leo, who was
the first to claim this submission from the East. They insisted,
furthermore, that this heterodox monarch should accept the definitions
of the famous Council of Chalcedon, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 451, which relate
to the nature and personality of Christ. The schism between East
and West had now lasted for thirty-one years, and a certain
Acacius, Bishop of Constantinople, who had been a most persistent
opponent of the demands of Leo the Great, was still a thorn
in the Roman pontiff&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>But Anastasius received the ambassadors with just as proud a
spirit as they had shown to him. He would neither yield to Leo
nor to Chalcedon, nor would he anathematize Acacius. Ennodius
and his companions returned to Rome without accomplishing their
mission, and the Emperor sent letters after them by Theopompus
and Severianus, principal men of his court. When these reached
Rome they were badly received by Hormisdas, and found that
nothing would answer except the excommunication of Acacius.
With this <i>ultimatum</i> they got back, somewhat crestfallen; and poor
Acacius (who was not half so bad as his papal foe) was once more
threatened with banishment to eternal fires.</p>
<p>Anastasius, however, was not at all inclined to hand over his
bishop to the mercies of Hormisdas. He stoutly refused and continued
to refuse throughout the ensuing correspondence. About
two hundred monks and archimandrites (heads of monasteries)
sent from Syria a letter to the Pope which was directed against the
patriarch of Antioch, Severus by name, and which gave in their
own allegiance to the Western Church. Nevertheless, the Emperor
still maintained the cause of Acacius, although he must have seen
that the Pope was as determined as ever to carry his point and
that there was now a great deal which was working in favor of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
papal plans. When the Syrians addressed their letter to the
&ldquo;Most holy and blessed Hormisdas, Patriarch of the whole earth,
holding the see of Peter the prince of the apostles,&rdquo; it spoke volumes
for what the Pope had been able to effect by his agents and
representations in the East. But the Emperor would not yield
the point and act upon the conciliatory policy of the heretical
Theodoric of Italy, which was that they might settle religious
matters in their own fashion, provided they honored absolutely his
temporal sway.</p>
<p>A second embassy was set on foot consisting of Ennodius and
Peregrinus, Bishop of Misenum. By these ambassadors letters
were sent renewing the old conditions and avowing that nothing
would be satisfactory short of the complete banishment of that
pestilent wretch Acacius. This was too much for the Emperor to
bear. He angrily dismissed the legates, shipping them off in an
old and leaky vessel, and giving a special order to Demetrius and
Heliodorus to see that they did not set foot in his dominions after
they had once sailed for home. Behind the flying ambassadors
followed a document which expressed the royal mind with force
and vigor. After comparing the conduct of the Pope very unfavorably
with that of Jesus Christ, the Emperor proceeds to say:
&ldquo;We shall give you no further trouble, it being in vain for us to
pray or entreat you, since you are obstinately determined not to
hearken to our prayers and entreaties. We can bear to be despised
and affronted, but we will not be commanded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was dated July 11th, 517, and reveals an unexpected dignity
in the old Emperor, and it makes us glad to record that, while
he lived, the Bishop of Constantinople was at least preserved in a
salvable state.</p>
<p>But when Anastasius died, then Hormisdas began again upon
Justin, his successor, and never stopped until Acacius was struck
from the roll of bishops and until the East acknowledged the spiritual
supremacy of the West. That the victory was of no long
continuance or of any enormous value, does not prevent us from
noticing that it gave to Magnus Felix Ennodius his permanent
place in the Roman calendar, and did everything for his literary
and ecclesiastical comfort. He was well rewarded for his devotion
to the cause.</p>
<p>Anastasius reigned 491-518, and Hormisdas, who had once
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
been married and had a son, who also became Pope, ruled in his
sphere from 514 to 523. Thus he had nearly five years wherein
to rejoice over his obstinate dead enemy. And Ennodius possessed
his soul in peace and turned his attention once more to polite
literature.</p>
<p>Of the writings which he has left to us, the principal are the life
of Epiphanius; another of Antonius of Pannonia, a hermit at
Lake Como and then a monk at Lerins; together with a <i>Eucharisticum
de Vita sua</i> and the apology and panegyric mentioned
above. Add to these nine books of letters, &ldquo;weighed down with
emptiness,&rdquo; and various itineraries, declamations, and poetical
pieces, and you have all he did. The letters are most unsatisfactory
when we remember that he was the friend, and perhaps the
relative, of men like Boethius, Faustus, Avienus, Caesar of Arles,
Aurelian, and of bishops and other prelates without number,
and lived in Italy under the great Theodoric. He is utterly lacking
in contemporary portraits, and his accounts of his three journeys
give us nothing valuable. All is stilted, unnatural, and dull.
He was not much of a traveller at best. A trip into Burgundy,
another across the Po to see his sister, and one from Rome by sea,
make up the list of which he kept any trace in his writings. He
is in no haste to detail the sayings and doings at Constantinople!
But it should be said that these performances with the pen were
previous to his elevation to the mitre. Afterward he doubtless
composed only hymns and epigrams&mdash;the hymns being decent and
the epigrams very much the reverse. The German scholar Teuffel
looks upon his productions as an &ldquo;important source of history&rdquo;
for some enigmatic reason of his own, but Simcox very justly
scouts them; and the Romanist Berington asserts that he rises
&ldquo;with weariness&rdquo; from their perusal. I must personally declare
that they exhibit neither skill, taste, nor information. They are
jejune and empty to a marvellous degree; and for complication
of sentences and unclassical phraseology, they are equal to the
stupidest books of a later day. And nothing worse than this can
be said by any critic.</p>
<p>The <i>Eucharisticum</i> is an insincere sort of thanksgiving for his
restoration to health, and very far behind the style of Augustine
which it copies. It gives us a few particulars of his personal history,
but it is prosaic and Pharisaic, and full of a mock humble
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
glorification of the blessed Victor the Martyr, by whose intercession
he is now convalescent.</p>
<p>The hymns are a trifle more hopeful, and really merit our notice.
They are by no means the &ldquo;dozen tame hymns&rdquo; of which Simcox
speaks so contemptuously. There are sixteen of them and three
are quite good. Here, for instance, is the <i>Christe lumen perpetuum</i>:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Christ, the eternal light</p>
<p class="t">Of every sun and sphere,</p>
<p class="t0">Illumine thou our mortal night</p>
<p class="t">And keep our spirits clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let nothing evil smite,</p>
<p class="t">Nor enemy invade;</p>
<p class="t0">And let us stainless be, and white,</p>
<p class="t">By nothing base betrayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Guard thou the hearts of all,</p>
<p class="t">But chiefly of thine own;</p>
<p class="t0">And hold us, that we may not fall,</p>
<p class="t">Through thy great might alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;That so our souls may sing,</p>
<p class="t">When favoring light they see;</p>
<p class="t0">And every vow and tribute bring</p>
<p class="t">To God in Trinity.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Christe precamur</i> is quite as good:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To thee O Christ we ever pray</p>
<p class="t">And blend our prayer with tears;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou pure and holy One, alway</p>
<p class="t">Protect our night of years!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our hearts shall be at rest in thee;</p>
<p class="t">In sleep they dream thy praise,</p>
<p class="t0">And to thy glory, faithfully,</p>
<p class="t">They hail the coming days.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Give us a life that shall not fail;</p>
<p class="t">Refresh our spirits then;</p>
<p class="t0">Let blackest night before thee pale,</p>
<p class="t">And bring thy light to men!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our vows in song we pay thee still,</p>
<p class="t">And, at the evening hour,</p>
<p class="t0">May all that we have purposed ill</p>
<p class="t">Be right through sovereign power!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>There is yet one more hymn which seems worthy of a place in
our regard. It is the <i>Christe salvator omnium</i>:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Christ, the Saviour of all,</p>
<p class="t">Thou Lord of the heavens above;</p>
<p class="t0">We ask thy glorious aid</p>
<p class="t">Before the day shall remove.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The sun is hastening down;</p>
<p class="t">His light is sunk in the west;</p>
<p class="t0">He hideth the world in gloom,</p>
<p class="t">According to God&rsquo;s behest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Do thou, most excellent Lord,</p>
<p class="t">As we thy followers pray,</p>
<p class="t0">To us, all weary with toil,</p>
<p class="t">Grant quiet night on our way.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;That day, from our darkening hearts,</p>
<p class="t">May never withdraw her light;</p>
<p class="t0">But, safe in thy guardian grace,</p>
<p class="t">Thy love illumine our night.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The poetical and spiritual range of these lyrics is not extensive,
of course, but it is a vast improvement on those &ldquo;uncleanly imitations
of Martial,&rdquo; or such involved and heartless tricks of verse as
he sometimes essays. But he became a saint, and that must suffice!
His life has been written by Sirmond; and his times and life
together have occupied the attention of Fertig (Passau, 1855).
He died at Padua, as we are credibly informed, on July 17th
(XVI. Kal. Aug.), 521, and this date is assigned to him in the
Roman Catholic calendar of saints. His epitaph, according to
Despont, who wrote in 1677, was still to be found in the church
of St. Michael, and testimonies to his services are among the acts
of the Fifth Synod of Rome, and are included in the public papers
of Hormisdas.</p>
<p>When you break open the important historical facts with which
he was identified, then like the toad from the stone, comes forth
Ennodius. And like that toad, though &ldquo;ugly and venomous,&rdquo;
he yet &ldquo;wears a precious jewel in his head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">CAELIUS SEDULIUS AND HIS ALPHABET HYMN.</span></h2>
<p>Latin hymnology gives a distinguished place to a hymn of
twenty-three stanzas, each stanza containing four lines and beginning
with a letter of the alphabet in regular order. Thus from
A to Z all the letters appear except J, U, and W. Caterva is
spelled Katerva, to answer for K. Y is represented by <i>Ymnis</i>,
which is another form of <i>Hymnis</i>. And at last <i>Zelum</i> concludes
the list. The author struggles with a difficulty when he takes
<i>Xeromyrrham</i> to answer for X, but otherwise the ideas and versification
are so excellent as to have made the hymn classic. The
Roman Breviary uses two selections from it. One commences <i>A
solis ortus cardine, ad usque</i>, and the other, <i>Hostis Herodes impie</i>.
The general subject is the Nativity, but the poem soon proceeds to
the Miracles of our Lord, and closes with an ascription of praise
for His Resurrection.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt about the authorship. Old manuscript
codices, and the tradition of the Church, assign it definitely to
Caelius Sedulius&mdash;sometimes called Caius Caelius Sedulius&mdash;who
flourished near the middle of the fifth century. But his personal
history is much harder to come at, and the few facts which we
possess only stimulate our curiosity to know more. And besides,
he is so entangled with another Sedulius&mdash;also a poet, also a celebrated
author, also a Scot, and also involved in much obscurity&mdash;that
nearly every notice of his name contains more or less of error.
This second Sedulius, however, wrote no hymn which has survived,
and therefore needs no further mention. He is always named
Sedulius <i>Scotus</i>, to distinguish him from our Sedulius, who is
invariably called <i>Caelius</i> Sedulius. He flourished somewhere
between 721 and 818, while the best ascertained date of his predecessor&rsquo;s
life appears to be 434.</p>
<p>Our sources of information regarding Sedulius are Isidore of
Seville and Fortunatus of Poitiers. Jerome (Hieronymus) left a
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
catalogue of authors from the time of St. Peter to his own day.
This was continued by Gennadius, as Notker of St. Gall tells us,
and then it was still further extended by Isidore. Neither Jerome
nor Gennadius mention our poet; the first because he died in 420,
before Sedulius had achieved distinction, and the second possibly
for the same reason, as his death occurred about 496 at Marseilles.
Isidore (who died 636) then undertook to supply the deficiencies of
the catalogue and inserted a brief note respecting Sedulius.</p>
<p>Earlier than Isidore, however, is Fortunatus (530-609), who
names our author as one of the five first Christian poets. Juvencus
he dates at 330 <span class="small">A.D.</span>; Sedulius flourished in the first half of
the fifth century; Prudentius was converted in 405; Paulinus
died in 458, and Arator was at his zenith in 560. This would
seem to fix pretty closely the period to which Sedulius belongs.</p>
<p>References in the manuscripts are of no additional value. They
tell us that he was a &ldquo;Gentile layman,&rdquo; or, in other words, a
person not of Italian birth; that he learned philosophy in Italy;
was converted and baptized by Macedonius, a presbyter; and that
he wrote his theological works in Arcadia, or, as some say, Achaia.
The Vatican &ldquo;Codex of the Queen of Sweden&rdquo; calls him a
&ldquo;verse-maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;teacher of the art of heroic metre.&rdquo; Another
codex adds that he also taught other varieties of metrical composition,
and that all this happened in the days of the younger Theodosius,
son of Arcadius, and of Valentinian, son of Constantine.
Of his specific writings still another codex states that he &ldquo;put
forth in Achaia this book against error and composed in verse a
commendation of the Christian faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Sedulius, &ldquo;notable for his writings,&rdquo; appears to have
found his way into Spain where, in the year 428, Isicius, a Palestine
monk, who had become Bishop of Toledo, detained him for
his good fellowship at Toledo. With him is said to have tarried
a certain Bishop Oretanus, and the inference is that these three
worthies held numerous symposia upon theology and literature.
But the story is denied by Nicolaus Antonius, the historian of old
Spanish scholarship.</p>
<p>Those minute and laborious investigators, the Benedictines,
have, with ant-like patience, threaded every corner of the labyrinth
in which these stray facts are gathered. They assert that Macedonius
probably received him after he had been baptized by some
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
one else. And while we do not know under what master he
studied theology, nor even where the school was located, we know
that Sedulius became presbyter in a church whose bishop&rsquo;s name
was Ursinus, and where Ursicinus, Laurentius, and Gallicanus
were his co-presbyters.</p>
<p>Ussher relates that the epithet <i>Scotigena</i>&mdash;the Scot&mdash;was frequently
applied to him. Trithemius gives us to understand that
he was led by love of learning to visit France, then Italy, then
Asia, and then Achaia, and that his reputation was gained in the
city of Rome. Sixtus Senensis compares him to Apollonius of
Tyana in his zealous pursuit of wisdom; and enlarges the list of
countries which he traversed by adding Britain and Spain. Under
Theodosius and at Rome, he too declares Sedulius to have been
famous in prose and verse. But Ussher first claimed him for
Britain; and Ussher it was who maintained that he was a pupil of
that Hildebert who ranks among the earliest of the Irish bishops.
It must not be forgotten that somewhere in Britain in those days
there was the light of Christianity, for in 432 St. Patrick set out
from Scotland &ldquo;to convert Ireland.&rdquo; Nor can we omit to notice
that Ussher styles Sedulius &ldquo;Scotus Hybernensis,&rdquo; thus originating
the expression &ldquo;Scotch-Irishman,&rdquo; but using it in exactly
the reverse of its modern sense.</p>
<p>So far as these partial facts and conjectures go we are safe in
affirming that Sedulius was a learned and studious person, probably
an Irishman&mdash;for at that time Scot and Irishman were synonymous&mdash;and
that he gained renown about the year 434, having
studied in Italy, travelled extensively, and been a resident in
Achaia. The temptation is, however, irresistible to make him
Irish rather than Scotch, upon the strength of the most ancient
&ldquo;bull&rdquo; on record. It is found in the Alphabet Hymn and reads thus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Quarta die jam foetidus</p>
<p class="t0">Vitam recepit Lazarus,</p>
<p class="t0">Cunctisque liber vinculis</p>
<p class="t0">Factus superstes est sibi.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Upon the fourth day Lazarus</p>
<p class="t0">Revived, though all malodorous;</p>
<p class="t0">And freed from the enchaining ground</p>
<p class="t0">Himself his own survivor found!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="clear">The writings of Sedulius are more numerous than might be supposed.
Those which have been preserved are nine, two in verse
and the rest in prose. The most elaborate is a commentary on
the four Gospels, dedicated to the abbot Macedonius and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
which he prefixed his <i>Carmen Paschale</i>. He also wrote on the
Pauline Epistles, as did his namesake of the ninth century. To
Theodosius he addressed a book. He wrote treatises on the
books of Priscian and Donatus, the grammarians. He also treated
of the miracles of Christ in prose and sent out many &ldquo;epistles of
Sedulius Scotigena.&rdquo; His poetry is comprised in the Alphabet
Hymn; in the <i>Carmen Paschale</i> whence we get nothing for hymnology
except the hexameter <i>Salve Sancta Parens enixa</i> (<i>puerpera
regem</i>); and in the Elegy, from which comes the <i>Cantemus socii</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Carmen Paschale</i> is an epic in the Virgilian style. The
Elegy is an exhortation to the faithful. But the Alphabet Hymn
has enriched the Church with two lyrics, one on the Nativity and
one on the Slaughter of the Innocents. By placing the first stanza
side by side with the first stanza of the famous Ambrosian hymn,
it is easily seen that they are the same.</p>
<h3><i>Ambrosian.</i></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A solis ortus cardine</p>
<p class="t0">Et usque terrae limitem</p>
<p class="t0">Christum canamus principem</p>
<p class="t0">Natum Mariae virginis.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3><i>Sedulian.</i></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A solis ortus cardine</p>
<p class="t0">Ad usque terrae limitem</p>
<p class="t0">Christum canamus principem</p>
<p class="t0">Natum Maria virgine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="clear">But this is no unusual occurrence in days when the language of
the Psalms was employed in the Ambrosian hymns, and when
the Ambrosian hymns themselves furnished a convenient foundation
for the later praises of the Church. Not only did Sedulius
imitate them closely, but Ennodius, Fortunatus, Gregory, Bede,
Rabanus, and Damiani&mdash;with many other unknown writers&mdash;studied
and copied their metre and expression. A curious instance
of this same copying and following can be found in our
own hymn. In it the stanza, <i>Ibant magi quam viderant</i>, contains
two lines which have been inserted bodily in a production of the
fourteenth or fifteenth century. It is true that they are very suggestive
and beautiful, but when Sedulius wrote</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Stellam sequentes praeviam</p>
<p class="t0">Lumen requirunt lumine,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he wrote what was original with him, but which was sheer theft in
the hands of the author of <i>Hymnis laudum preconiis</i>, who nevertheless
takes the couplet to grace the feast of the Three Kings.</p>
<p>Latin hymns are by no means all beautiful or all graceful. The
earlier pieces appear and reappear&mdash;fragments from the better
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
workmanship of the past&mdash;throughout the Dark Ages. And here
we must leave Sedulius. If he was indeed the companion of
Hildebert, his story belongs to that fabulous age of the British
Church when bishops were but simple pastors and when great
purity and truth prevailed. In the Alphabet Hymn there are
references to the direct Scripture narrative; to the &ldquo;enclosed
John&rdquo; who greets the Saviour; to Him fed with a little milk,
who Himself feeds the birds; to the great Shepherd revealed to
shepherds; to Herod who seems to fear a King who does not
covet earthly dignities; to the Magi who seek their Light from
the light; to the healing of the sick and the raising of the dead;
to the water that blushes into wine, as perhaps Crashaw had read;
to Peter who fears by nature and walks the wave by faith; to
Lazarus &ldquo;his own survivor;&rdquo; to Judas the <i>carnifex</i> who professed
peace by his kiss which was not in his soul; to Him who triumphing
over Tartarus returned of Himself to heaven. Such is
the hymn, and upon reading it one is not surprised that Fortunatus
called its author <i>Sedulius dulcis</i>&mdash;the sweet Sedulius. Nay,
Rudolph of Dunstable goes so far as to perpetrate a pun, and declares
that Sedulius <i>sedulously</i> sings of things that are old and new.
And the dear man of God, Dr. Martin Luther of blessed memory,
who had no relish for Ambrose&rsquo;s hymns, called our Irishman a
<i>poeta Christianissimus</i>, and translated into his massive German
both the hymns the Breviary had extracted from his chief poem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">VENANTIUS FORTUNATUS THE TROUBADOUR.</span></h2>
<p>Venantius Honorius Clementianus Fortunatus was a man
not satisfied with four names. In jest or earnest he assumed another,
Theodosius. In point of time he had an interesting position;
in regard to residence his story becomes really valuable;
and when we add that he gave to the Church several of her best-known
hymns, he appears before us as a person unfamiliar, but
highly attractive.</p>
<p>If, as we have reason to think, he came into France in 566 or
567, at the age of thirty-five or thirty-six, we must suppose him to
have been born about 531. He was an Italian of Treviso, which is
not far northwest of Venice and northeast of Padua. Of his
parentage and early education (except the fact that he was trained
at Ravenna) we are ignorant; but he is said to have been acquainted
with Boethius, a thing hard to believe, for the philosopher
perished in 524. We are left in some doubt whether he
had set forth from Italy because the Lombards were about to invade
his part of it, or whether religious motives were at the bottom
of this &ldquo;exile,&rdquo; as he is very ready to call it.</p>
<p>Judging his unknown past by his better-known later history, he
was a man of affable and genial character, who could pay for all
favors in the small coin of panegyric, and whose pen filled his
pocket and procured him the hospitality of the rich and the great
of the earth. We know he could sing, for he says so himself;
and he could also turn verses so sweet and mellow that even the
poorest of them were learned by his admirers and recited again
with much delight. Now it happened that his eyes were affected,
and his friend Gregory of Tours sent him some of the blessed St.
Martin&rsquo;s holy lamp-oil. When this was rubbed upon them&mdash;and
it was doubtless good oil, and therefore not an objectionable ointment&mdash;he
was greatly helped. He consequently showed his
gratitude in two ways: by making a pilgrimage to the blessed St.
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
Martin&rsquo;s own town, and by writing the blessed St. Martin&rsquo;s biography.
This last he accomplished to the extent of four books of
verse, employing, without any apparent scruple, the much more
classic and elaborate treatise of Sulpicius Severus as the groundwork
of his own. It was this journey which raises the question
whether he was avoiding the Lombards or performing a pious vow
when he entered France. Perhaps in this, as in other events of
his life, the religious garment covered the secular desire.</p>
<p>From his native country, then, he made his way into another
and less cultivated region. There was a Gallo-Roman society at
the time, very much as there now are groups of educated persons
in Siberia, or in the seaboard cities of China. A certain freemasonry
of intelligence passed a literary man along from castle to
cloister and from cloister to court. It was a period when
classic learning was at its lowest ebb, and when the Romance
tongues, like the second growth of a forest, were thickly clustering
in upon the few survivors of the ancient groves of literature. The
sixth century was removed from the past, but had not attained to
much on its own account.</p>
<p>Yet we must not think that this century was barren of beginnings.
The Merving kings&mdash;Clovis, and Childebert, and Clotaire
the First, and Charibert&mdash;had now given place to Chilperic
on the throne of France. Indeed, some writers are inclined to
make this sixth century the true commencement of the Middle
Ages, and it is very certain that we can see a great deal in the story
of Fortunatus which is mediaeval. Moreover, Mohammed was
born in 570, at Mecca, while our future bishop was traversing
Gaul. And nearly contemporary with our author&rsquo;s birth&mdash;that is,
in 533&mdash;comes the announcement of the supremacy of the Roman
bishop, which culminated in 590 in the strong administration of
Gregory the Great. Fortunatus lived, therefore, in days when
Latin Christianity was taking shape, and when the most aggressive
of false religions was springing up. We have indeed said, in
effect, that the Western Empire was at an end, and that the Monarchy
of France had begun in 476.</p>
<p>Thus, as he looked backward, the Italian refugee could recall
the successive blows of barbarian swords&mdash;the swords of Alaric,
and Genseric, and Attila, and Odoacer&mdash;under which Rome had
fallen. When Alboin started his raid from Pannonia in 568, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
Lombards (Longobardi) and Gepidae and twenty thousand Saxons,
it was surely enough to make a troubadour take refuge at Tours.</p>
<p>Our materials for the biography of Fortunatus from this point
in the story become more available. He kept an itinerary, which
was lost; but he wrote often to Gregory of Tours, and this seems
to be the only correspondence which he conducted in a natural
and ordinary manner. From it we learn that he crossed the
mountains in a &ldquo;snowy July,&rdquo; and had written either &ldquo;on horseback
or half asleep.&rdquo; He passed some time at Metz and Rheims.
His days and nights were spent in travelling and feasting and in
preparing songs and odes, to the consternation of his modern
biographer, Luchi, who does not find much evidence of piety in
these proceedings.</p>
<p>Fortunatus is his own exponent, and his language, literally
translated, gives us a vivid picture of the way in which he made
friends with everybody. &ldquo;Travelling among the barbarians&rdquo;
(he writes to Gregory), &ldquo;on a long journey, either weary of the
way or drunk beneath the icy chill, at the exhortation of the muse
(I know not whether more cold or sober), a new Orpheus I gave
voices to the wood, and the wood replied.&rdquo; The sentence illustrates
not merely his experience but also his style of composition,
which is turgid and frequently obscure. His panegyrics, for example,
abound in the most fulsome flattery, arrayed bombastically
in a string of nouns, verbs, and adjectives half a page long. The
real idea walks within much of his Latin, like a pigmy in a great
court train, ridiculously small and ridiculously pretentious.</p>
<p>Sometimes these same expressions of our poet betoken a convivial
familiarity with his friend Gregory of Tours, which is not
precisely canonical. Many post-classical words appear, and
phrases which no grammarian would easily justify. The man is
full of sly hints of good eating and drinking, and has a high-flown
style of compliment, as when he writes to Lupus, &ldquo;As often as I
put together the parts of your discourse, I thought that I reclined
upon ambrosial roses.&rdquo; To Sigismund and Aregesles, two
brothers, he declares that, &ldquo;This sweet letter reveals to me the
names of friends. Here is the brilliant Sigismund, and here is the
modest Aregesles. After Italy, O Rhine, thou givest me parents,
and by the coming of these brothers I shall be no longer a
stranger.&rdquo; In fact, he picked up &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; and &ldquo;parents&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
with charming facility, and had a dexterity in drawing a corner of
the mantle of royal favor over him which any courtier might covet.</p>
<p>Thus he went&mdash;we cannot well detect in what order or by what
method, but pretty conclusively as a troubadour might have done&mdash;all
through France. Like Chamisso, he proposed to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Take his harp in his hand</p>
<p class="t0">And wander the wide world over,</p>
<p class="t0">Singing from land to land.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>With Sigebert, King of Austrasia, he contracted quite a friendship,
and being at Poitiers when Gelesuintha was put to death, he
lamented her in verses which pleased Sigebert, her brother-in-law
and avenger, greatly. He also became well acquainted with Euphronius
of Tours, nephew of St. Gregory, the bishop, and thus
laid a good foundation for ecclesiastical preferment. But it was to
Poitiers that he gradually drifted, and there circumstances fixed him
for the most of his life.</p>
<p>We may safely conclude that Tours, which is not a great distance
off, first attracted his wandering feet. He had a duty to the
blessed St. Martin&rsquo;s holy lamp and to the blessed St. Martin&rsquo;s
holy memory, and these devout proceedings were more than sufficient
to commend him to a hospitable bishop. Contemporary
accounts of him are lacking, if we except the brief notice of Paul
the Deacon, which cannot properly be called contemporary, as it
is in his history of the Lombards, which was prepared in the first
half of the eighth century. But Fortunatus again comes to our
rescue with quite a goodly supply of verses and with some epistles
which show that the life of that period was a curious resultant
between the Roman and barbarian ideas. It ought in honesty to
be added that Brunehilda was no saint, and that the court of the
Merovingians was so barbaric that it stood by and saw her torn to
death, at eighty, at the heels of a wild horse; and this was later
even than Fortunatus&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>By this time Treviso (Trevisium) had been regularly attacked
by the Lombards, and the pilgrimage, which had changed to a
pleasure-trip, changed again to a residence. He speaks of himself
later as having been &ldquo;for nine years an exile from Italy,&rdquo; and his
only reference to his family that is discoverable is when he tells
the Abbess Agnes that she is as dear to him as his own sister
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Titiana. He is a poet driven like a leaf before the storm, and he is
whirled first into Tours and then into the safe eddy of Poitiers, which
he celebrates reverently in song as the home of the great Hilary.</p>
<p>His royal friendships are made apparent by <i>epithalamia</i>&mdash;especially
that on the marriage of Sigebert and Brunehilda&mdash;and by
various odes. But now comes the real romance of our poet&rsquo;s life.
Clotaire the First had married a fair woman named Radegunda,
whose piety gave him not a little trouble. She was determined to
keep all her vigils and fasts and to exert herself in works of charity,
even to the scrubbing of the base of the altar with her own hands.
It was one of her greatest pleasures to take leprous women in her
arms and kiss them, and when one of the lepers said to her, &ldquo;Who
will kiss you after you embrace us?&rdquo; she &ldquo;answered benevolently,
that if others will not kiss me, it is truly no affair of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be beneath the dignity of this narrative, if it were not
a portion of her own life in the Latin, for us to record the incident
which helped to cause her separation from her husband. She had
arisen at night and came back thoroughly chilled, and with her
feet properly cold. Clotaire growled out that he would sooner
have a nun for a wife (<i>jugalem monacham</i>) than such a queen.
So she took him at his word, founded a convent at Poitiers, and
distinguished herself to later generations by many noble works.</p>
<p>Over this convent she placed her maid Agnes, and served her
former servant with profound humility and obedience, albeit she
must always have been herself the ruling spirit of the place. With
Fortunatus she formed a close friendship. And as this is the beginning
of the conventual and ecclesiastical side of his career, we may
as well bring the story up to its parallel point in current history.</p>
<p>Gregory, Archbishop of Tours and historian of France, always
addresses his friend Fortunatus as <i>presbyter Italicus</i>. That Fortunatus
embraced the monastic life at Aquileia (about 558-59) has
been maintained, and the opinion is also fairly defended that he
was enrolled as a &ldquo;cleric&rdquo; at Poitiers, although he was <i>novus</i>, or
a &ldquo;new-comer,&rdquo; there. He had evidently some <i>quasi</i> ecclesiastical
connection, and those were days when the celibacy of the
clergy was much mooted, but when the wandering monks had not
yet been held to the stringencies of the monastic orders. If we
ask Fortunatus why he remained in Gaul, he replies that Radegunda
retained him there &ldquo;by her prayers and vows.&rdquo; It is conjectural
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
that he was first chaplain to the convent, and it is certain
that then he was elevated to the rank of Bishop of Poitiers.</p>
<p>To this daughter of Berthar, King of the Thuringi, our troubadour
now paid his devoirs. Often at &ldquo;the convivial banquets of
the barbarians&rdquo; he had &ldquo;poured forth his verses.&rdquo; He was now
to become the devoted cavalier of a queen and an abbess, and to
furnish literature with some very unique specimens of religio-amatory verse.</p>
<p>The life of Radegunda, written by Fortunatus and amplified by
the nun Bandonivia, furnishes many interesting facts about this holy
woman. She took her final resolution to separate from her husband
after he had unjustly put her brother to death. On this she
went to St. Medard and declared her intention of celibacy, and
thence to the church of St. Martin, at Tours, where she made her
formal vows. From this she retired to her villa called Suedas,
near Poitiers, which she turned into a convent. Thither in 569
the Emperor Justinus (Justin II.) sent rich presents, one being a
portion of the true cross. This inspired Fortunatus with a new
song, and he broke out in the <i>Vexilla Regis</i>, which is surely one
of the most stirring strains in our hymnology.</p>
<p>The following version expresses literally and without modification
the ideas set forth in the Latin:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;VEXILLA REGIS PRODEUNT.&rdquo;</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The royal banners forward fly;</p>
<p class="t0">The cross upon them cheers the sky;</p>
<p class="t0">That cross whereon our Maker hung,</p>
<p class="t0">In human form, by anguish wrung.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>At this time Fortunatus also composed a long poem of thanks
to Justin and Sophia for gifts sent to himself, by which it would
appear that he was tolerably well identified with the interests of
Radegunda and her convent.</p>
<p>From this date onward his friendship with Agnes and Radegunda
exposed both him and them to very considerable comment. He
even refers to it in one of his poems, addressed to the abbess, in
which he protests the purity of his conduct. But it is not hard to
see how his expressions might be misunderstood. They are frequently
fervid beyond the courtesies of compliment, and they remind
us all the while of those singers of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries who begin with William, Count of this very city of
Poitiers (1071-1127), and who have made the name of &ldquo;troubadour&rdquo;
synonymous with the praise of love and beauty. Fortunatus
calls on Christ, and Peter, and Paul, and Mary to witness the
entire propriety of his love for Agnes and Radegunda, but he follows
it with lines which Bertrand de Born or Alain Chartier might
have composed.</p>
<p>Really there is a great deal of this exuberant poetry in the worthy
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
chaplain. He wrote every sort of odd acrostic on the holy
cross, reminding us in more ways than one of Damasus, or of the
later cavalier poets of England. He tells Radegunda, who seems
his principal star, that everything is alike when he does not see
her; that although the sky is cloudless, yet, if she is absent, &ldquo;the
day stands without a sun.&rdquo; He excuses himself in other verses
for sending her violets instead of lilies and roses. Any incident
in which Radegunda plays a part is enough to turn the poetic
stream upon the mill-wheel of his verse. If there are flowers on
the altar; if there are flowers sent by her to himself; if she has
retired from the world to perform her vows; if she has returned
again to the public gaze, and especially if he has been at a little
dinner or has received some agreeable little dishes&mdash;then the bard
strings his harp!</p>
<p>It is quite amusing to read some of these effusions. He advises
Radegunda, as Paul did Timothy, to drink wine on occasion.
And when the queen and the abbess conspire to make his life
pleasant he has plenty of metrical gratitude to offer. They send
him butter (<i>butyr</i>) in a lordly dish; they furnish chestnuts in
baskets woven by their own hands; they provide milk, and prunelles,
and olives, and eggs. For all these he renders thanks in
kind. Never were eggs and butter sung in a loftier strain! But
sometimes the poet descends a trifle from his elevated phrases.
He says pathetically in one of these effusions that they sent him
&ldquo;various delicacies for his full stomach&rdquo; (<i>tumido ventre</i>), and that
he got asleep after it and failed to furnish the appropriate verses.
He laments this in proper metre, declaring that he had opened his
mouth and shut his eyes (the old gormandizer!) and had eaten
on, regardless of his duty. And for this he craves forgiveness
from his <i>beata domnia</i> [it ought to be <i>domina</i>] <i>filia</i>&mdash;his blessed
queen-daughter. But be good enough to observe that his own
gifts in return are very small, and that he is always apologizing
and hoping that they may not be rejected. Truly this was such a
man as Sir Walter Scott has sung, for</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The best of good cheer and the seat by the fire</p>
<p class="t0">Was the undenied right of the barefooted friar.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Only it may be safely questioned whether our Fortunatus was any
more of an ascetic than Damasus himself. One almost wishes for
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
an historical picture&mdash;and it should be a good theme, by the way&mdash;in
which Fortunatus and his two friends appear. It should be
that celebrated feast which he describes [J. P. Migne: <i>Patrologia</i>;
<i>Opera Fortunati</i>, Lib. xi., cap. ii.], where Agnes had adorned the
tables and the apartment with &ldquo;every species of blossoming plant;&rdquo;
where the rich wines, and the generous fare, and the crystal, and
the gold, and the flowers should brighten the fine hall of the
chateau; and where, perhaps, the ecclesiastic should take his
small harp and strike its strings with a delicate hand, while the
fair face of Agnes and the darker beauty of Radegunda should
inspire his song.</p>
<p>One traces to this mellow undercurrent of human life the swing
of his best lyrics&mdash;the <i>Pange lingua gloriosi praelium certaminis</i> and
those hymns to the Virgin of which he was the earliest promoter.
No ene can doubt the influence of these women upon the <i>Ave
maris stella</i> or the <i>Quem terra pontus aethera</i>. Say what we please
about his piety, he has written what will live with the best. And
to compare him to the melancholy Cowper, as Mrs. Charles has
done, can only be characterized as a most amusing misconception.</p>
<p>We know nothing of him as bishop further than the fact that the
office became vacant in 599, and he was an available as well as
distinguished candidate. Surviving Radegunda, who passed away
in 587, he died about 609, full of years and honors&mdash;the last of
the classics and the first of the troubadours; the connecting link
between Prudentius and the Middle Ages; the biographer of some
of the saints and the interested collector of many legends of their
miracles; and, finally, the first of Christian poets to begin that
worship of the Virgin Mary which rose to a passion and sank to
an idolatry. Venantius Fortunatus was neither a bad man nor,
in the highest sense, a holy man. But he was a poet in spite of
his barbaric Latin, and a writer of hymns which live to-day, long
after the particulars of his career are forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">GREGORIUS MAGNUS [540-604].</span></h2>
<p>The materials which are at hand for the life of Gregory the
Great are, if anything, too numerous. In their original form they
include all that Paul the Deacon (quoted by the Venerable Bede)
and John the Deacon (quoted by everybody) have chosen to relate.
And these have been so anxious to do entire justice to the great
Pope that they fill their pages with miracles, wonders, and signs,
as well as with the authentic facts of history. But Gregory carved
for himself such a niche in the temple of fame that we are not
likely to go very far astray in searching for the proper estimate of
his work.</p>
<p>It may be safely assumed that from this pontificate dates the
supremacy of the Roman see. It was Gregory whose missionary
spirit opened the doors of Britain to the truth. It was he who,
without asserting any superior claim, opposed successfully the
encroachments of the Greek patriarchs. And it was again he who
gave to the Church her sacred melodies.</p>
<p>He was born, says Paul the Deacon, in the city of Rome, of a
father named Gordianus and a mother named Sylvia. These
people were of the Anician family and were also of distinguished
religious descent. Felix&mdash;fourth of the name and Pope under the
title of Felix III.&mdash;was his <i>atavus</i>, or great-great-great-grandfather.
The very name Gregorius our worthy deacon declares to be the
Greek equivalent of the word &ldquo;Watchful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child of such a house would be well nurtured in all the
learning of the time. Hence, he was trained in grammar, rhetoric,
and dialectics&mdash;the ancient <i>trivium</i> or complete course of liberal
education. Naturally, too, he became an excellent scholar. And
when he grew up he was called to an important post in Roman
civil affairs. He became praetor of the city&mdash;a city which was
subject to Byzantium and exposed to incursions of various barbarian
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
invaders. The Lombards, indeed, attacked it during his
praetorship.</p>
<p>At this period of his life his love for display was as remarkable
as his subsequent simplicity. He delighted in rich attire and surrounded
himself with the pomp and circumstance of his position.
A rich man and a rich man&rsquo;s son, he was thoroughly in sympathy
with passing affairs, and as Rome bloomed the more vigorously
above her own decay, he was himself one of those &ldquo;flowers of
evil&rdquo; whose gaudy hues brightened the scene. But at the same
time he became accustomed to the management of large affairs,
and his administration secured to him the good will of his associates
and subordinates. It can often be noticed that these early
Fathers came to their power in the Church after having been strictly
and carefully trained in the world. Hilary and Ambrose were as
conspicuous examples of this foreordination as was Gregory the
Great.</p>
<p>Not long previous to this time&mdash;for it had been about the year
of Gregory&rsquo;s birth&mdash;Benedict had reformed the monastic order.
His work, to put it briefly, consisted in guarding the entrance to
monasticism and in regulating the hours, habits, and customs of
those celibates who professed such a vocation for the religious life.
From his wise and systematic arrangements, which have been but
little improved upon though often reinforced by &ldquo;reformations,&rdquo;
monasticism derived that adaptation to the active and practical life
of the West, which it had lacked in the preceding centuries. Indeed,
he so far reacted against the contemplative idleness of the
East, as to aim rather at an industrial than a learned order. But
his successors corrected this defect, and gave the order the literary
and educational character which has been its greatest claim to the
gratitude of Christendom. Thus it came to be that the Benedictine
Fathers became the order of scholars, the editors of the Fathers, of
the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, and of the <i>Histoire Litteraire de France</i>. The
permanent revenues, the fixity and quiet of these monastic lives,
the slow coral-building of these unknown workers, have resulted
in gathering for us all that the mediaeval historian can desire upon
the religious side. And it is here that, delving amid the dust of
these mountainous masses of literature, the student of Latin
hymnology will find his rarest delight. For these acute scholars
have literally picked up and printed, yea, and what is more to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
purpose, they have indexed and classified&mdash;whatever he can wish
in the way of productions in prose and verse by any known author.
The old <span class="small">MSS.</span> are strained through into readable type. Their contents
are sorted and sifted. And he who pores over these pages
will rise from them at length with a profound conviction that the
scholarship of the Latin Church, and particularly the Benedictine
Order, deserves well from the world of letters and merits the admiration
of the Church Universal.</p>
<p>Into such an order as this&mdash;an order of which he was to be
one of the most illustrious lights&mdash;a divine impulse was pressing
Gregory. He grew more closely attached to the Benedictines of
Monte Cassino. His religious relatives encouraged his evident
zeal. And thus after vibrating like a bee between the odorous
rose and the honey-giving clover, he settled upon the humbler and
sweeter flower and let the world go by.</p>
<p>The Arian Lombards had encamped upon that region which we
after their name now call Lombardy. The Roman bishops were
already the prop of the heathen state against the semi-Christian invaders;
but with Lombards, and those whose religion was only a
fiction, their influence was deplorably slight. Yet as Christianity
increased, according to George Herbert&rsquo;s simile,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Like to those trees whom shaking fastens more,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the Church became doubly influential through the skill of Gregory.
He felt religion to be the source of the truest strength and thus he
turned his wealth and his life into its treasury.</p>
<p>In the year 575 he took his great revenues and endowed six
new monasteries in Sicily. Then he established a seventh, devoting
it to the honor of St. Andrew; and this was at Rome, in
his own palace on the Coelian hill. The populace who had seen
him in silk and jewels now beheld him, a poor monk of the Benedictine
Order, serving the beggars at the gate. In humility of
demeanor and in simplicity of food he became a model to his fellow-monks.
He attended the sick in his new hospital. He ate
only the dried corn, or pulse, which his mother sent to him already
moistened in a silver bowl. This bowl or porringer was the only
relic of his departed splendor, and we are told that he did not
keep even this, but gave it at last to a shipwrecked sailor for
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
whom he had no money, and who begged importunately from
him when he was writing in his cell.</p>
<p>The intensity of his devotion led him into great austerities of
fasting and prayer and study of the Scriptures. He outdid the
others in his abstinence from food and ended by ruining his health,
so that he entered the papacy with a broken constitution. When
he most needed the support of a vigorous body it was therefore
denied to him.</p>
<p>The history of his gradual elevation is suggestive. Pope Benedict
I. made him one of the seven cardinal deacons, and gave him
charge of one of the seven principal divisions of the city. Pelagius
II. chose him to head an embassy to Constantinople in 578 to
congratulate Tiberius on his accession to the throne. For six
years he remained abroad on this and similar service, and returned
to Rome to be elected abbot of St. Andrew&rsquo;s monastery. Here
he was perfectly happy. In his <i>Dialogues</i> he speaks of the serene
life and death of several of his brethren, and his latest biographer
(Rev. J. Barmby) is never tired of relating how the great Pope
perpetually looked back with regretful love to those quiet and
happy days of peace with God and man.</p>
<p>It was then that the famous incident occurred which has made
historic his missionary zeal, and has handed down three Latin
puns as a proof that a man can be witty as well as earnest.</p>
<p>The slave market at Rome had received some new captives&mdash;alas!
when was it not the scene of fresh wretchedness in those
awful times? But these were of remarkable beauty and fairness
of skin, and John the Deacon shall tell us of them in his own
words:<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Perceiving among the rest certain boys for sale, white of body,
fair in form, and handsome in face, distinguished moreover by the
brightness (<i>nitore</i>) of their hair, he asked the merchant from what
country he had brought them. He answered, &lsquo;From the island
of Britain, whose inhabitants all display a similar beauty (<i>candore</i>)
of face.&rsquo; Gregory said, &lsquo;Are those islanders Christians or do they
yet hold to their pagan errors?&rsquo; The merchant replied, &lsquo;They
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
are not Christians, but are entangled in their pagan delusions&rsquo;
(<i>laqueis</i>). Then Gregory, groaning deeply, said, &lsquo;Alas! for
shame! that the prince of darkness should own those splendid
faces; and that such glorious foreheads (<i>tantaque frontis species</i>)
should express a mind vacant of the inward grace of God!&rsquo; Then
he asked the name of their tribe. The merchant responded,
&lsquo;They are called Angli.&rsquo; Then he said, &lsquo;They are well called
Angli, as though they were angels (<i>angeli</i>) for they have angelic
faces; and such as these should be fellow-citizens of the angels in
heaven.&rsquo; Again, therefore, he inquired what was the name of
their province. The merchant told him &lsquo;Those provincials are
called Deiri.&rsquo; Then Gregory said, &lsquo;They are well called Deiri,
for they must be snatched from wrath (<i>de ira</i>) and gathered to the
grace of Christ. The king of that province,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;how
is he named?&rsquo; The merchant replied, &lsquo;He is called Aelle.&rsquo;
And Gregory, alluding to the name, said, &lsquo;It is well that the king
is called Aelle. For <i>Alle</i>luia in praise of the Creator must be
sung in those parts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the commencement of that Christianizing process
which eventually brought Anglo-Saxon monks to Rome for education&mdash;not
that Rome was the chief source and centre from which
the work of Christianizing the English was effected. That strangely
organized Church, which Patrick had established in Ireland and
Columcille (Columba) had propagated to Celtic Scotland, was the
missionary Church of that age. Its zeal carried the faith to Scandinavia
in the person of its royal converts, the two Olafs, besides
Christianizing the Norsemen of Ireland and the lesser islands. Its
missionaries poured southward across the lines that sundered Saxon
from Celt, and co-operated mightily with the more languid efforts
of the Kentish Church established by Augustine. And up to the
Synod of Whitby in 664, Patrick rather than Peter was the saint
who stood the highest in the esteem of English Christians.</p>
<p>Yet it would be unfair to rob Gregory and Augustine of the
honor of having begun the work, and begun it on a higher and
more permanent level than was possible to the Irish Church.
After all, Rome stood for a wider conception of Church and social
order and a broader Christian culture. It is to her victory that
we owe Bede and the great Churchmen, who adapted the learning
and lore of the Latin world to the needs of English Christendom.
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
And so in Augustine&rsquo;s mission we may see the apostolic succession,
in a broader sense of the word than the technical, carried to England,
to be transmitted in turn to America. England acknowledged
the gift in the establishment of the tax called &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Pence&rdquo; for
the care and support of pilgrims to Rome, and the support of
clerics, who went to study in the Saxon school established in Rome.
To this we may trace, perhaps, the spread of hymn-writing from
Rome to England, whose results are gathered into the Missals and
Breviaries of Sarum, York, and Hereford, and that elaborate compilation,
&ldquo;The Hymns of the Anglo-Saxon Church,&rdquo; which Rev.
J. Stevenson edited for the Surtees Society.</p>
<p>The mission of Augustine led to far-reaching consequences.
One was that the higher classes of Great Britain turned toward
Rome as the centre of the world, and one of the remoter consequences
of this missionary expedition was the recognition of the
papal supremacy. But in his highest flight of authority Gregory
the First never assumed nor felt the consciousness of power which
caused Gregory the Second to write to Leo, the Isaurian: &ldquo;All
the lands of the West have their eyes directed upon our humility;
by them we are considered as a God upon earth.&rdquo; No, nor did
he press his claims as did his other successor, Gregory VII., some
times known as Hildebrand.</p>
<p>Indeed, Gregory I. in his desire to save these beautiful captives
offered himself to Pope Pelagius as a missionary, and even obtained
his consent to the expedition. But we are informed that
the people surrounded the pontiff on his way to St. Peter&rsquo;s and
begged him to recall their favorite. So that Gregory had gone
but three days&rsquo; journey before he was overtaken and brought back,
almost forcibly, to his monastic home. The scheme of saving
Britain was thus deferred but not given up; and when the cardinal-deacon
became Pope it was again revived, and with success.</p>
<p>In the year 590 Pelagius II. died of the plague. His chair was
no sooner empty than Gregory was seen to be the choice of everyone&mdash;senate
and people and clergy. He was accordingly elected,
and then&mdash;for such was the feeling in those days&mdash;he resisted the
honor with all his might. Like Ambrose he fled from the city;
he disguised himself; he even wandered in the woods. But it
was one of the old principles that the more the elect refused the
more their calling and election were to be made sure to them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
And therefore, he was found at last, after a thorough search, and
was led, literally in tears, back to Rome. He had begged the
Emperor Maurice not to confirm this appointment, but it was to
no effect that he pleaded for release. His quiet, peaceful days
were over, and he was placed at the helm of the ship of the Church
to steer her, and the commonwealth which was her freight, through
floods of barbarians and into safer seas. I am using his own
figure: &ldquo;I am so beaten by the waves of this world,&rdquo; he wrote,
to his friend Leander, &ldquo;that I despair of being able to guide to
port this rotten old vessel with which God has charged me. I
weep when I recall the peaceful shore which I have left and sigh
in perceiving afar what I cannot now attain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his seat in the midst of the plague. Eighty persons in
the processions which he organized at seven points in the city to
pray at the church of Santa Maria-Maggiore for its cessation, died
of the disease during their very progress. Each procession met
the others at this church of St. Mary. One consisted of secular
clergy; another of abbots and monks; a third of abbesses and
nuns; a fourth of children; a fifth of laymen; a sixth of widows,
and a seventh of matrons. And thus arose the story about the
angel whom Gregory believed that he saw above the summit of the
Mole of Hadrian, and who there stood and sheathed his sword.
This legend gave to that structure the name of the Castello di San
Angelo, the Castle of the Holy Angel.</p>
<p>The Lombards were Gregory&rsquo;s first care. He corresponded
with Theodolinda, their queen, and she became his constant friend
and his advocate with the king. He finally obtained from King
Agilulf (her second husband) a special truce for Rome and its
neighboring territory&mdash;a most delightful relief from the terrors of
the last thirty years.</p>
<p>Moreover, he directed his attention&mdash;as Hormisdas had done
before him&mdash;to the struggle which was never at rest between the
Greek and Roman churches. The Patriarch of Constantinople
was determined to assert his own superior claims to the veneration
of the faithful. Hormisdas had avowed&mdash;but never vindicated&mdash;the
supremacy of the Pope. But his title of <i>Papa</i> was the result
of mere adulation and never of general consent. And the patriarch
happened to be at this time the strong-willed John the Faster&mdash;an
austere and pugnacious man. It was natural therefore that
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
he should claim the title of Universal Bishop, and it was equally
natural that Gregory, without demanding anything especial for
himself, should resist John.</p>
<p>In this controversy&mdash;and in those others where his works bear
testimony to his literary and political skill&mdash;we see Gregory at his
best. He is not deficient in satire; occasionally he indulges in
playful humor; but he never forgets principle nor flinches from
the prosecution of his cause. It cannot be said of him that he
proposes to overrule the civil authorities, but he unquestionably
tells them some exceedingly plain truths. To the Emperor Maurice
he wrote remonstrating against his refusal to allow a soldier to
become a monk: &ldquo;To this by me, the last of His servants and
yours, will Christ reply, &lsquo;From a notary I made thee a count of
the body-guard; from a count of the body-guard I made thee a
Caesar; from a Caesar I made thee an emperor; nay, more, I
have made thee also a father of emperors; I have committed My
priests into thy hand; and dost thou withdraw thy soldiers
from My service?&rsquo; Answer thy servant, most pious lord, I
pray thee, and say how thou wilt reply to thy Lord in the judgment,
when He comes and thus speaks.&rdquo; In this style he alternately
appealed and remonstrated in his dealing with the powers
that be.</p>
<p>To John the Faster, however, he administered gall and honey&mdash;sometimes
separately and sometimes mixed together. &ldquo;Your
holy Fraternity,&rdquo; he says, on one occasion, &ldquo;has replied to me,
as appears from the signature of the letter, that you were ignorant
of what I had written about. At which reply I was mightily astonished,
pondering with myself in silence, if what you say is true,
what can be worse than that such things should be done against
God&rsquo;s servants and he who is over them should be ignorant?&rdquo;
Two monks had in fact been beaten with cudgels for heresy and
finally resorted to Rome in defiance of John, where Gregory pardoned
and restored them. The Pope continues: &ldquo;But, if your
holiness did know both what subject I wrote about and what
had been done, either against John, the Presbyter, or against
Athanasius, monk of Isauria and a presbyter, and have written to
me, &lsquo;I know not,&rsquo; what can I reply to this, since Scripture says,
&lsquo;The mouth that lies slays the soul?&rsquo; I ask, most holy brother,
has all that great abstinence of yours come to this, that you would,
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
by denial, conceal from your brother what you know to have been
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are, in spite of this plainness, disposed to be severe upon
Gregory&rsquo;s subservience to the civil power of the Byzantine Court,
we shall find an instance in his behavior toward Phocas. This
man had murdered the Emperor Maurice, gouty and helpless as
he was; and had previously put his six sons to death before his
eyes. The good old emperor died like a hero, repeating the words
of the psalm, &ldquo;Thou, O Lord, art just, and all Thy judgments are
right.&rdquo; And we need only to turn to Gregory&rsquo;s writings to prove
that the dead man was his friend and had done him many a kindness.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these gracious and excellent memories of the
late emperor, the Senate and people had hailed the advent of
Phocas with rapturous delight. His image and that of his wife
had been sent to Rome, and now, with the uproar rising to his
windows, Gregory descended to the common level of detestable
approbation, and caused these images to be carried into the oratory
of the Lateran palace. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says one of his biographers, &ldquo;is
the only stain upon the life of Gregory. We do not attempt either
to conceal it or to excuse it.&rdquo; True, Maurice had been a vexatious
old man, and his piety, while it was undeniable, was nevertheless
somewhat acrid. But the Bishop of Rome should have
had sufficient strength at least to repress any tumultuous joy over
an act of murderous ambition and hateful selfishness. This, however,
is the weakness of many a prelate. In the hour of trial he
bends like a reed to the blast, when we should expect him to be an
oak, and trust to his roots to grapple him safely down to the firm
earth of principle. This great blot, conceded by all candid historians,
remains upon his memory.</p>
<p>It is a better picture for us to view when, forsaking his trust in
the mercy of barbarians or the senility of despotic power, Gregory
looked outward to the new nations and sought to furnish the
Roman Church with fresh vigor and vital help from this unwasted
source of strength. He corresponded with Childebert II., the
unfortunate young King of Austrasia, the son of the notorious but
intellectual Brunehilda. With him and with the French bishops
he labored to secure the destruction of &ldquo;simony,&rdquo; by which was
meant the bargain and sale of ecclesiastical positions. He also
strove to prevent laymen from being elevated to the episcopate,
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
though he should have remembered that Hilary of Poitiers was a
notable argument against his fears.</p>
<p>He also attended to the religious matters of Spain. This province
had ceased to be Arian in 587 with the accession of Recared;
and with it and with Istria he was entirely successful in his methods
of unity and peace. He also overcame the Donatist party in
Africa, who had for years been ordaining their own bishops side
by side with the regular succession, and sometimes in actual alternation
with them.</p>
<p>To crown all, he organized a mission to the distant island of the
fair-faced Angli in 596, the very date at which the young Childebert
perished by poison in the twenty-sixth year of his age. Then
it was that Augustine, after one recoil which showed that he was
not quite up to the mark of Gregory&rsquo;s zeal, finally set out in earnest
with forty companions. The month was July. The mission
was almost an embassy. It went through the intervening kingdoms
endorsed to and by their kings. And it went to cheer the
little feeble remnant of the Celtic Christians who had escaped the
Saxon sword, and to draw from the Venerable Bede his grateful
tribute to the man who had already well deserved the title of great.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; says Bede, &ldquo;if Gregory be not to others an apostle, he is
one to us, for the seal of his apostleship are we in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we remember, also, his secular services in saving Rome
from sack and pillage, we cannot but perceive that he was laying,
broad and deep, the foundations of that temporal authority which the
Pope of Rome was soon to claim. The revenues of the Roman
bishop were growing enormously. He had in Sicily and elsewhere
his agents and stewards (<i>defensores</i>). He was rapidly arising
to a position of almost independent dignity. His deference to
kings was only that of Christian courtesy and love. In another
man some of this might have been disfigured by self-seeking and
moral obliquity of purpose. In Gregory we find, throughout his
career, a noble integrity which was certainly austere enough, but
which was in the main pure and free from spot. His weakness
was that of overconciliation, of which the case of Phocas is a
flagrant example. But his strength was in his just judgment and
in his masterful manipulation of the materials before him.</p>
<p>In his way, too, he saved Christian art as well as Christian
music. He condemns the Bishop of Marseilles (Massilia) for
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
having broken some statues of the saints. And while his remonstrance
may perhaps be quoted in favor of image-worship, it certainly
cannot be quoted for that blind iconoclasm which would
destroy pagan beauty before the shrine of Christian ugliness. In
the association of his name with the Gregorian chant he did almost
as great a kindness to the Church as did Ambrose when he brought
to her services the Greek hymns of the East.</p>
<p>He was a sick man while he labored at these matters of devotion
and duty. Rheumatic gout attacked him and crippled his joints.
We must add to this that he was not without enemies, and not
without many a little sting and thrust of vicious tongues and pens.
But he endured to the end, and he probably was sincere when he
wrote himself down as <i>Servus servorum</i>&mdash;though there have been
other popes since his day to follow the custom, and who were the
&ldquo;servants of servants&rdquo; only according to the &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s darling sin,
the pride that apes humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirteen years he held the keys of St. Peter. Busy until the
last moment, he wrote or dictated the correspondence which was
required. But the disease which was upon him steadily increased
until, on March 12th, 604, he was released from suffering and
from care. His portrait shows him as a man with high and
wrinkled forehead; a thin beard around the cheeks and chin;
large, deep-set eyes; straight and manly nose, and a singular lock&mdash;almost
like that in the conventional portrait of Father Time&mdash;upon
his brow. There are a great many doctors of divinity who
do not a little resemble him to-day. It is a good face, but a
somewhat stern and severe one&mdash;of the sort to make credible the
story that he had a special whip for his choristers, and used it
when it was needed.</p>
<p>His works fill several volumes in the <i>Patrologia</i>. His <i>Morals</i>,
a commentary upon Job, is the very best of his books; but
he was probably ignorant of both Hebrew and Greek, and
hence his comments on Scripture are rather more homiletical and
practical than scholarly. The <i>Pastoral Rule</i> was translated into
Saxon by King Alfred, who admired its practical wisdom, and
sent a copy to every bishop in his kingdom; under Charles the
Great also it was much esteemed in France. His <i>Letters</i> are
the great mine of information upon his personal opinions and
methods. The <i>Dialogues</i> were addressed to Theodolinda, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
in these we find some superstition; and indeed a fondness for
saints&rsquo; miracles and a weakness for relics were characteristic of his
otherwise sensible conduct. He wrote but nine hymns which are
authentically traceable to his pen. They are the <i>Primo dierum
omnium</i>; the <i>Nocte surgentes vigilemus</i>; the <i>Ecce jam noctis</i>;
the <i>Lucis Creator optime</i>; the <i>Clarum decus jejunii</i>; the <i>Audi benigne
Conditor</i>; the <i>Magno salutis gaudio</i>, the <i>Jam Christus astra ascenderat</i>,
and the <i>Rex Christe, factor omnium</i>. With a lesser degree
of probability he has been named as the author of the <i>Aeterne
Rex altissime</i>; the <i>En more docti mystico</i>; the <i>Lignum crucis mirabile</i>;
the <i>Noctis tempus jam praeterit</i>; the <i>Nunc tempus acceptabile</i>;
and the <i>Summi largitor praemii</i>.</p>
<p>Of these the <i>Rex Christe, factor omnium</i> delighted Luther so
much that he declared it in his impetuous way &ldquo;the best hymn
ever written&rdquo;&mdash;an opinion which he would find few nowadays to
endorse. Gregory disliked pagan literature and cultivated the
style and prosody of Ambrose. It is possible, therefore, that among
the Ambrosian hymns there may be those which he has written
and which are credited to an earlier date. But the cause of hymnology
suffers little by the loss. He was not a poet; but as the
man who made the papacy a thing and not a name&mdash;as the man
who evangelized Britain&mdash;and as the man who gave the Gregorian
tones to the praises of the Church, he will be held in kindly and
lasting remembrance. There was in him a vein of peculiar sarcasm
as well as of deep earnestness and of great sagacity, yet his
literary merits are not to be weighed against those words and
actions written viewlessly on the air, but which still effectually

<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE VENERABLE BEDE.</span></h2>
<p>It happened with Bede as with some other Latin hymn-writers&mdash;there
were several persons who had the same name as himself.
Hilary and Fortunatus and Notker are not the only cases of confusion,
for there were certainly three Bedes, and they were not
long removed from each other in point of time. Beda Major&mdash;the
elder or greater Bede&mdash;was a presbyter and monk of Lindisfarne,
commemorated by his more celebrated namesake. Another
was a holy man of the time of Charles the Great. But our own
Beda or Bedan was a presbyter and monk of Jarrow, and is distinguished
from the rest by the title of &ldquo;Venerable,&rdquo; which he
shares with Peter the Venerable of Cluny.</p>
<p>There are few finer figures in early English history. Sprung
from pagan and utterly illiterate ancestry, he has taken his place
as an historian, a scholar, a natural philosopher, and a poet; and
in every department of this varied knowledge he has shown his
ability and industry. English literature recalls him; English history
praises him; English scholarship has elaborately edited his
writings, and English patriotism has affectionately honored his
memory.</p>
<p>Cuthbert, his disciple, who wrote his life, begins his narration in
the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The presbyter Beda, venerable and beloved of God, was born
in the province of Northumbria, in the territory of the monasteries
of the Apostles Peter and Paul, which is in Wearmouth and at
Jarrow, in the year of our Lord&rsquo;s incarnation the six hundred and
seventy-seventh, which is the second year of the solitary life of St.
Cuthbert.&rdquo; It also was the ninth year after the reduction of Saxon
England to the Roman obedience at the Synod of Whitby.</p>
<p>Bede himself relates that when he was seven years of age the
care of his education was committed by his relatives to the Abbot
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
Benedict and afterward to the Abbot Ceolfrid. He adds that from
that date to the time at which he prepared the accompanying list
of his works he had spent his days in the same place. His existence
was passed in meditating upon the Holy Scriptures; and he
&ldquo;found it sweet,&rdquo; in the midst of his observance of the conventual
discipline and daily chanting in the church, &ldquo;either to
learn, or to teach, or to write.&rdquo; The choice of this word &ldquo;sweet&rdquo;
(<i>dulce</i>) is significant, for no man could more carefully have mingled
the sweet with the useful. A gentle spirit breathes across his studious
pages, as over the rough beards of the yellow grain a breeze
moves and sways them, harsh though they are, in graceful waves.
For he loved learning with a perfect avidity. His works reveal his
desire to accumulate it&mdash;to teach it again in plain and simple
fashions&mdash;and this benevolent desire redeems many a tedious
discourse.</p>
<p>This life of his was devoid of personal incident. He includes
nothing of his individual history in the little notices which he
makes of contemporary events, and he is singularly silent even
about the affairs of which we should think he would naturally
speak. The light which we get upon his surroundings and circumstances
we must, therefore, derive from other sources, but
fortunately these are at hand. We know, for example, that Benedict
Biscop, who founded those twin monasteries in which Bede
dwelled all his life, was himself a remarkable person. He was of
noble birth, and gave up place and ambition in the court of the
king to proceed to Rome, there to be trained as a monk, and then
to return and found Wearmouth in 674 and Jarrow in 682. To
the second of these religious establishments, situated upon the
Tyne, Bede was transferred under Ceolfrid, its first abbot, and
there thenceforth he remained. We are even able to determine
his usual food as a school-boy, for, says his latest biographer, Rev.
G. F. Browne, &ldquo;we have a colloquy in which a boy is made to
describe his daily food in his monastery. He had worts (<i>i.e.</i>,
kitchen herbs), fish, cheese, butter, beans, and flesh meats. He
drank ale when he could get it, and water when he could not;
wine was too dear.&rdquo; There is, indeed, in these Saxon monasteries
the honest and hearty food which belonged to their age
and people. Cedric the Saxon, in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel of
<i>Ivanhoe</i>, represents very fairly the popular feeling on the subject.
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Chaucer, too, can be quoted upon this same profusion and
the generosity of the time. Of the Franklin he says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It snowed in his house of meat and drink.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>With such a patron as Biscop the monasteries never lacked any
good thing. He brought back from the Continent the best matters
of the period&mdash;books, pictures, relics, skilled mechanics, makers
of stained glass, and choir-masters. He saw before him a land in
which the monk was to be the conservator and promoter of learning.
And in carrying out this purpose he did more than plant a
monastery, for he planted and reared a man. We have the word
of that historian whose life and death so nearly approach those of
his favorite author, when we declare that &ldquo;prose took its first shape
in the Latin history of Baeda.&rdquo; For John Henry Greene closed
his history of the English people much as Bede ended his own
career, weary with his labor and yet completing what he had
begun.</p>
<p>That which lies before us is what Greene finely styles &ldquo;the
quiet grandeur of a life consecrated to knowledge.&rdquo; It was no
hoarding, avaricious, trilobite life to be fossilized for future ages
in the dead strata of ecclesiastical records. Instead, it concerned
itself with all learning; and though it perished in the blackness of
a general ignorance, it is a source of light and force to-day.</p>
<p>But let us return to Bede&rsquo;s brief points of change. While he
was still a boy, the monastery was desolated by one of the great
plagues which followed the Synod of Whitby, and every monk
who knew how to sing in the choir, except the Abbot and Bede,
were among the victims. Unaided these two struggled with the
double task of teaching the others to sing and keeping up the
monastic services in the mean time. The antiphons they had to
abandon, but they struggled through the Psalms, often weeping
and sobbing as they sang. At nineteen&mdash;six years before the
usual age&mdash;he became a deacon; at thirty he was a priest; at
fifty-nine he died. He acquired his Greek through the agency of
Archbishop Theodore, who had come from Paul&rsquo;s city of Tarsus
in Cilicia. There were many in England who actually spoke in
that tongue, owing to his encouragement of it. And Bede was
no mean nor small factor in its diffusion, for he taught at Jarrow
a school of six hundred monks, besides an uncounted number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
strangers who sought his instruction. The genealogy of school
masters is truly suggestive. From Bede to Alcuin, from Alcuin
to Rabanus Maurus, from Rabanus and his liberal methods on
to the times of Abelard and the free inquiry; so the torch of
learning passes down the generations. And when we remember
Alcuin&rsquo;s commendation of Bede and Rabanus Maurus&rsquo;s instruction
by Alcuin, we cannot doubt the close connection of these
three earliest names. Abelard really revived the bolder and
broader style which had been opposed at first in the Abbey of
Fulda.</p>
<p>How the monk ever found time for his accomplishment of
study and writing among his constant labors&mdash;his chanting
and his teaching and his frequent preparation of homilies&mdash;it is
indeed hard to discover. But he wore away the thin scabbard of
the body by the keen edge of his sheathed and unsheathed mind,
until he died before his days were truly done. How often must
we lament the incredible monotony and weary routine of these
noble lives! How much more, we say to ourselves, they could
have achieved under better and freer conditions! But perhaps
not. Perhaps this very constriction was a source of strength; and
perhaps the severe stress which finally broke this noble student
was, after all, the creator of his best powers and the director of
his finest energy.</p>
<p>Did he ever visit Rome? Monks from the Anglo-Saxon
monasteries went on pilgrimage back and forth, but if he went
with them neither he nor they have mentioned it. Yet there is a
letter of Pope Sergius to Ceolfrid which hints at such a journey,
and might easily furnish a ground for the opinion. On the whole,
we must consider Bede as an unflickering light, burning itself
away at Jarrow, but illuminating all England with its rays. It is
not because of deficiency in acquirement that we deny these traditions.
He knew all that was then current. His writings are an
encyclopaedia of universal learning. Honorius of Autun says
of him, <i>scripsit infinita</i>&mdash;he wrote incalculably much. Lanfranc
cites his <i>Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation</i>. Alcuin
compares him to the Younger Pliny, and quotes him with great
delight as &ldquo;Magister Beda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymns ascribed to the Venerable Bede, on what appears to
be good authority, are the following:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<dl>
<dt><i>Adesto, Christe, vocibus</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Apostolorum gloriam</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Emitte, Christe, Spiritum</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Hymnum canamus gloriae</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Hymnum canentes martyrum</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Illuxit alma seculis</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Nunc Andreae sollemnia</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Praecessor almus gratiae</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Praecursor altus luminis</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Primo Deus coeli globum</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Salve tropaeum gloriae</i>.</dt>
</dl>
<p>Also, but more doubtfully:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Apostolorum passio</i>,</dt>
<dt><i>Inter florigeras</i>.</dt>
</dl>
<p>His Ascension hymn,</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Hymnum canamus gloriae</i>,</dt>
</dl>
<p>in its abbreviated form, spread beyond the bounds of English
use, and found favor with the Churches of the Continent. It has
simplicity and directness, if not much poetic force and is too
prolix for Church use in its original form. Mrs. Charles&rsquo;s version,
&ldquo;A hymn of glory let us sing,&rdquo; is well known. Next to it stands his</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Hymnum canentes martyrum</i>,</dt>
</dl>
<p>known to English readers by the admirable version in <i>Hymns
Ancient and Modern</i>, which begins, &ldquo;A hymn for martyrs sweetly
sing.&rdquo; A third notable hymn is that to the Cross:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Salve tropaeum gloriae</i>,</dt>
</dl>
<p>in which he embodies the beautiful legend of St. Andrew&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The notable thing about all Bede&rsquo;s hymns is the influence which
the old forms of Teutonic poetry&mdash;the alliterative staff-rhyme&mdash;have
exerted on their construction. We can even trace an approximation
to alliteration in his verses, while rhyme is rather an
accident than an object. The verses of Beowulf and of Caedmon
were in his mind when he wrote. That he could use the classic
metres also, we see from his poem in hexameters on the life of
Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, the great Scoto-Irish saint, whose deeds
still filled the North with their echoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">RABANUS MAURUS, AUTHOR OF THE &ldquo;VENI, CREATOR.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>None of the great Latin hymns is more regarded than the <i>Veni,
Creator Spiritus</i>. The <i>Dies Irae</i> may be grander; the <i>Veni,
Sancte Spiritus</i> may be sweeter; the <i>Ad perennis vitae fontem</i> may
be lovelier; the <i>Stabat mater</i> may be more pathetic, but, after all,
the <i>Veni, Creator</i> holds a place of equal honor in the estimation
of the Church. The Church of England, while rejecting every
other Latin hymn from her services, nevertheless retained this in
the offices for the ordering of priests and consecration of bishops.
This is only the carrying out, indeed, of the account given by the
famous but unknown monk of Salzburg who rendered so many of
the Latin hymns into the old High-German tongue. He says,
&ldquo;Whoever repeats this hymn by day or by night, him shall no
enemy visible or invisible assail.&rdquo; This has always been the repute
of the hymn, and there is no doubt that this attended it on
its journey down the ages in the worship of the Church.</p>
<p>Its authorship, however, has been less carefully preserved than
its text, which is notably free from mutilation and obscurity. It
is really singular to find a hymn which has been so universally
employed, and which has escaped in such a marvellous manner
from the profane meddling of prosaic or bigoted revisers. Its
doxologic final stanza is one which is not often to be found elsewhere&mdash;as
though the hymn had taken and maintained a place
apart. If it were the product of the Ambrosian age this would not
be likely to have occurred, for all those doxologies are formal and
interchangeable to a marked degree. But this is the appropriate
conclusion of a unique ascription of praise to the third person of
the Trinity.</p>
<p>Its date is thus, to some extent, fixed for us. We cannot refer
it to the days of Ambrose, and, since it is found in nearly all the
twelfth to fourteenth-century breviaries, we are unable to attribute
it to the period of the Renaissance. Its very verse would prevent
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
this, if nothing else did. The word <i>spiritalis</i> is a barbarism&mdash;an
altogether post-classical expression. The true usage is that in
which the genitive case is employed, thus &ldquo;spiritual delight&rdquo;
would be <i>animi felicitas</i>, not <i>spiritalis</i>
(or <i>spiritualis</i>) <i>felicitas</i>.
<i>Perpetim</i> is also a word which purists of the new classic revival
would avoid if they could. So, too, there is a certain amount of
stress to be put upon the scanning of <i>Paraclitus</i>&mdash;where the <i>i</i> is
long, though Prudentius in the fifth century and Adam of St. Victor
in the twelfth both make it short. It has therefore been said
that the hymn was composed by a person who was skilled in the
Greek language. This altogether depends on the question whether
he pronounced the word by accent or by quantity. But still it is
not to be denied that the prosody of the poet gives us reason to
think that he did pronounce the word with the accent on the &eta;.
If this be so, it would follow that he was a man of rare and fine
scholarship in comparison with the contemporaneous learning.</p>
<p>Another criticism is purely theological and aids in fixing the
date by the history of doctrine itself. At the Council of Toledo
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 589, the word <i>filioque</i> was added to the Creed to indicate
the faith of the Church in the procession of the Holy Spirit
from both the Father and the Son. This hymn preserves this
point of the orthodox belief with such care that there can be no
doubt of its being subsequent in time to the date of that council.</p>
<p>In coming more particularly to the various authors who have
been credited with its composition, it may be well to attend to
each claim as it is put forward in some sort of chronologic order.</p>
<p>George Fabricius of Chemnitz (1564) was ready enough to ascribe
it to Ambrose himself. The only ground for this conjecture is
the structure of the verse. And this is no more a proof of authorship
than that a hymn written in what we call &ldquo;long metre&rdquo; must
be, because of that fact alone, the production of Isaac Watts. On
the other hand, it is plain that the theological allusion and the doxology,
when taken together, remove the hymn far enough away
from the days of the great Bishop of Milan.</p>
<p>In later times of more critical scholarship the learned and accurate
Professor Hermann Adalbert Daniel has devoted much study to
the hymn, and has reached the conclusion that it belongs to that
king whom the Germans are never tired of praising&mdash;Charles the
Great (Karl der Grosse), by the French called Charlemagne.
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
Led by his illustrious opinion the compilers and translators have,
without another question, set it down for Charles&rsquo;s work. So it
has gone; the minor German collators, like K&ouml;nigsfeld and others,
following peacefully in the rear of an original investigator. This
was not true, however, of men who hunted for proof on their own
account, as, for instance, Mone and Wackernagel. But it is distinctly
true of the English scholars, among whom Archbishop
Trench appears to carry the most prevalent influence. They
usually assent without a murmur to this conjecture of Daniel
indorsing Thomasius, who was, so far as can be discovered, the
parent of the opinion. The only real exception is the Scotch
hymnologist, Dr. H. M. MacGill, who doubts, but conforms to
the opinion which is in vogue.</p>
<p>The grounds of this general confidence in Charles&rsquo;s authorship
it may be proper to mention here in brief. We know it is said
that he was a patron of learning, a friend of scholars, and a devout
believer in the orthodox theology. In the year 809 he took an
active part in a synod at Aquisgranum which affirmed the doctrine
that the Holy Spirit proceeded from both the Father and the Son.
There is, furthermore, a statement, quoted by Cardinal Thomasius
from the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, which goes in the direction of a positive
assertion. In the life of the Blessed Notker it is said that this
hymn was composed by Carolus Magnus.</p>
<p>Now it has never been established that Charles was even a ready
writer of prose, to say nothing of verse. Berington, following
Einhard, Charles&rsquo;s secretary, says in his <i>History of the Literature of
the Middle Ages</i> (1814), that Charles was not a literary man.
&ldquo;He seems never to have acquired the easy practice of writing,&rdquo;
is his strong language (p. 102). The hymn, on the contrary,
bears the evident marks of accustomed skill and practice in the art
of verse as well as the accuracy of a mind trained in theologic discriminations.
Moreover, if Maitland (he of the Dark Ages) is to
be credited, then this life of the Blessed Notker, by Ekkehard
Junior, is full of errors, of ignorance, and wilful design. It naturally
celebrates whatever is likely to add to the credit of St. Gall.
Hence we need not be astonished when it tells us that Notker
composed the sequence, <i>Spiritus Sancti adsit nobis gratia</i>, and sent
it to Charles the Great, receiving in return his composition the <i>Veni,
Creator Spiritus</i>. Nor should we be surprised when this turns out
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
(as it is now conceded to be) a mere legend without any historic
basis. When Thomasius follows this story, and Daniel follows
Thomasius, and Trench follows Daniel, and the compilers follow
Trench, it really appears that but little independent judgment has
been exercised on the subject.</p>
<p>Notker died in 912, and as Charles the Great was dead in 814,
the absurd anachronism of the Ekkehard legend is clear to a
glance. It should perhaps be added that Trench, although allowing
Charles as author, believes the hymn to be possibly of earlier date.</p>
<p>Mone takes a new departure when he gives up the common
opinion and announces that the hymn ought to be assigned to
Gregory the Great (540-606). In his first volume he taxes Daniel
with having been altogether too prompt to agree to the cardinal&rsquo;s
dictum. He finds no reason to give the hymn to Charles, but he
regards the classical style of its composition to be very fitting to
the culture and well-known powers of Gregory. He rejects the
doxology <i>Sit laus</i>, etc., and considers, very justly, that the stanza
<i>Per te sciamus</i>, etc., is the true conclusion of the hymn.</p>
<p>Wackernagel agrees with Mone. He thinks that the only way
in which Charles could have secured the authorship would have
been by getting the composition effected by the intervention of
Alcuin. He therefore believes that Gregory was the poet of the
<i>Veni, Creator</i>, and so publishes it in his exhaustive work upon
the German church hymns. Professor March, always careful and
scholarly in his assignments, adopts this opinion also.</p>
<p>Against the Gregorian authorship, supported as it is by such
eminent and independent scholars, one must be slow to contend.
But in fact there is no great similarity between the hymn before us
and those of Gregory. The great Pope is not a great poet. He
has not written one hymn which has really endured. The <i>Audi
benigne Conditor</i> is quoted freely, and the <i>Rex Christe, factor omnium</i>
received Luther&rsquo;s highest approbation. But these and other
hymns from his pen are imitations of Ambrose&mdash;almost slavish
imitations. The lofty and grand largeness of the <i>Veni, Creator</i> is
wanting to them all. The argument, good as it may seem, is
only negative. The inference is that the hymn was written by
him&mdash;nothing more. On the same grounds we might as well go
back to old George Fabricius and give it into the hands of Ambrose
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
as he did. The truth is that Gregory&rsquo;s writings do not contain
it, and why they should not, if he were its actual author, it is
hard for any one to understand.</p>
<p>But we are not at the end of the inquiry yet. We positively
know certain facts. These are: That the earliest mention of the
hymn is in the <i>Delatio S. Marculfi</i>, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 898; that it is found in
the breviaries of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries; that its author
was a skilled theologian and probably a master of the Greek language;
that he was a poet in the true sense and therefore quite
certain to have written other hymns and poems; that it was so
soon and so generally adopted as to prevent any corruption of its
text; that all these ascriptions of it to this or that person are nothing
but tradition; and, finally, that the hymn has such spiritual
worth and power as to mark it for the production of a devout as
well as scholarly mind. All these requirements are met in
Rabanus Maurus, Bishop of Mainz, pupil of Alcuin, and laureate
after Alcuin and Theodulphus.</p>
<p>There was a certain Christopher Brower, a Jesuit and a profoundly
learned scholar, who was born in 1559 at Arnhem in
Gelderland. In the year 1580 he went to Cologne in pursuit of his
studies. Then he studied philosophy at Trier, and eventually
became rector of the college at Fulda. Here he wrote four books
upon antiquarian topics. His diligent, exhaustive style can be
judged by the fact that he spent thirty years upon a history of
Trier. His <i>Antiquitates</i> were printed in 1612, but in 1603 he
had edited the writings of Fortunatus, and this book was reissued
in 1617, the year of his death, by Joannes Volmar at Cologne.
This edition has an appendix of 150 pp. 4to., in which is contained
the entire series of hymns and other poetical compositions
which were due to the aforesaid Bishop of Mainz, Rabanus Maurus.
It was edited from a very old <span class="small">MS.</span> of undoubted veracity, and it contains
the <i>Veni, Creator</i> in the precise text which we now employ.
It is to be noticed that it does not recognize the doxology <i>Sit laus</i>,
etc., and this Mone assures us was composed at a later period by
Hincmar of Rheims, and is, as we have said, unique. But it
accents Paraclitus upon the second <i>a</i> and not upon the <i>i</i>.</p>
<p>The stanza <i>Da gaudiorum</i>, etc., was rejected some time ago by
the best scholars. It is from a hymn of later date. And we
therefore find the version which appears in Brewer&rsquo;s editions of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
poems of Rabanus Maurus to be consonant with the most intelligent
criticism of the text of the <i>Veni, Creator</i>.</p>
<p>The hymn itself we can assign with very considerable certainty
to the author in whose pages it again is apparent, and we may
believe in the accuracy and scholarly acuteness of the Jesuit antiquarian.</p>
<p>It will not be amiss if we set our reasons in order, for a
long-established delusion is as hard to overthrow sometimes as the
stubbornest fact. They are such as the following:</p>
<p>1. The hymn is found in the writings of Rabanus Maurus,
in a codex which Brower calls &ldquo;very ancient and well approved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. It is the precise paraphrase of the learned bishop&rsquo;s chapter
on the Holy Spirit. Thus he begins the chapter with an assertion
of the procession of the Holy Spirit from both the Father
and the Son. He then calls this Spirit <i>donum Dei</i>, and several times
repeats the phrase. He argues that the Spirit is coequal and coeternal
God. He then discusses the term <i>Paraclete</i>, and proceeds
to speak of the <i>septiformis</i> nature of His power. Next follows a
most significant and unusual expression&mdash;namely, that the Holy
Spirit is <i>digitus Dei</i>&mdash;the finger of God. And the consecution
and coincidence of thought is still further increased by an allusion
to the grace which bestowed the gift of tongues. He then speaks
of the Spirit as fire&mdash;which accords with the word <i>accende</i>&mdash;and
then he explains the simile of water, which corresponds with the
word <i>infunde</i> and with the previous phrase <i>fons vivus</i>. He also
quotes from the Gospel of John to show that this &ldquo;living water&rdquo;
means no more nor less than the Holy Spirit. These coincidences
are doubly remarkable, for they not only exhibit the same ideas&mdash;some
of which, by the way, are quite uncommon&mdash;but they also set
them forth in the precise order in which the good bishop employs
them in his hymn. It is as if, being aroused and animated by
his great and noble theme, he had turned to verse as an appropriate
medium of lofty praise and had sung from his heart this
immortal hymn.</p>
<p>3. To these reasons we may add a third&mdash;that the internal structure
of the hymn shows its author to have been a person of theological
soundness, spiritual insight, scriptural knowledge, genuine
scholarship, and a natural poetical capacity. These facts again
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
agree with what we know to have been the talents and learning of
Rabanus Maurus.</p>
<p>4. If Gregory had written this hymn it would have appeared at
an earlier date and would have been undoubtedly attributed to its
illustrious author; whereas it is not in his carefully compiled
writings nor is it accredited to him by Thomasius or any hymnologist
before the time of Mone and Wackernagel.</p>
<p>5. Charles the Great had not the learning, and both he and his
grandson, Charles &ldquo;the Bald,&rdquo; are named on the strength of a
long-exploded and always anachronistic tradition.</p>
<p>6. Ambrose is out of the question by the theological limitation
of the stanza <i>Per te sciamus</i>, etc.</p>
<p>7. Finally, we have the right to believe that a man whose other
hymns have been so extensively, though anonymously, introduced
into the worship of the Church, was entirely competent to frame
this present hymn.</p>
<p>This last point is worthy of more than this terse remark.
Rabanus composed the hymns, <i>Adest dies sanctus Dei</i>, <i>Festum
nunc celebre</i>, <i>Fit porta Christi pervia</i>, <i>Tibi Christe splendor Patris</i>,
<i>Christe Redemptor omnium</i>, and <i>Jesu Salvator saeculi</i>, all of which
display great powers of sacred poetry and two of which are beyond
any possible doubt his authentic productions. Of the twenty-nine
hymns found in Brewer&rsquo;s codex there are two which have been
credited to Ambrose beside the <i>Veni, Creator</i>, and there are seven
which are classed by Daniel and Fabricius as belonging between
the tenth and fourteenth centuries and to unknown authorship.
The codex adds to our previous list eight entirely new poems, and
two others which raise a question on which we may pause for a
moment before conceding the current opinion.</p>
<p>The first of these hymns is the <i>Altus prosator</i>, of which the
codex gives us a much fuller and longer version. It is called
ordinarily the &ldquo;Hymn of St. Columba,&rdquo; and was reprinted by Dr.
Todd from the <i>Liber Hymnorum</i> of old Irish hymns in the library
of Trinity College, Dublin. Our present line of inquiry would
lead us to assign it to Rabanus, and thus do away with the mere
conjecture which makes Columba its author.</p>
<p>The second hymn is that usually credited to Elpis, the wife of
Boethius. But the designation of this hymn is as fanciful as the
other. Brower in his loyalty to the Church will not impugn the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
authorship which is commonly received, but he is constrained to
admit that a stanza is appended which the popular version entirely
omits. It seems far more reasonable to think that Rabanus composed
the whole hymn than that he only added a few verses at the
end. What Rabanus Maurus really did was to construct an
<i>hymnodia</i> which had an appropriate sacred song for every season.
He was a poet and he lauded the verses of Hilary and of Ambrose.
Had he intended to make selections he would not have omitted
them. But he has certainly put his own compositions into this
list. Therefore it follows that he may well have included more
than was at first supposed. And when it is plain&mdash;for the index
of hymns makes it plain&mdash;that not one single hymn of the twenty-nine
is the undoubted and absolute property of any other poet,
we are safe in assuming that they all are what the codex declares
them to be&mdash;the actual productions of the Bishop Rabanus.</p>
<p>The hymn <i>Fit porta Christi pervia</i> occurs in the midst of the
Ambrosian <i>A solis ortus cardine, et usque</i>, and was there inserted
by the Benedictines of St. Maur. Daniel says it is an entire hymn
as it stands. And so say we who find it standing alone in the
codex of Brower.</p>
<p>At once, then, Rabanus Maurus ascends from comparative obscurity
to a front rank among hymn-writers. And we are ready
for all the light upon his personal history which we can obtain.</p>

<p class="clear">Rabanus Maurus, teacher and Abbot of Fulda and Archbishop
of Mayence (Mainz), was commonly called the &ldquo;foremost German
of his time.&rdquo; Though the centuries have somewhat obscured
the lustre of his renown, they have not deprived him of his place
in history, nor have they dissociated his name from that of his
instructor, prototype, and model, the great pedagogue Alcuin.</p>
<p>Of the birthplace of Rabanus we have no certain knowledge.
Some have said that he was Scotch or English, others that he was
French; but the more reliable authorities are convinced that he
was a German, born either at Fulda or Mainz. The epitaph
written by himself affords probably the solution of the question.
It was composed at Mainz while its author was archbishop, and
contains these words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Urbe quidem hac genitus sum, ac sacro fonte renatus,</p>
<p class="t0">In Fulda post haec dogma sacrum didici.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>That is, he was born at the place where he was writing these
verses&mdash;most likely Mainz&mdash;and there he was baptized. Afterward
he was educated in Fulda. An additional reason for this belief is
that his father was of a family known in the records of Mainz.</p>
<p>Trithemius says that Rabanus was born in 788 <i>quarto nonas
Februarii</i>, the second of February. Mabillon adds, &ldquo;I do not
know whence he got the day; the year is probably pretty close.&rdquo;
But the year itself, on the strength of internal evidence found in
the man&rsquo;s writings and in the monastic rules regarding the holding
of office before the attainment of a fixed age, Mabillon places at
776. This extension of twelve years is a very important affair
since it makes Rabanus a monk of thirty-three at the date of the
Council of Aquisgranum (Aix-la-Chapelle or Aachen), called by
Charlemagne to reannunciate the doctrine of the procession of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The name of Rabanus&rsquo;s father was Ruthard and his mother was
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
christened Aldegunde. &ldquo;She was a woman of the most honest
conversation,&rdquo; as Trithemius declares, the fit helpmeet of a man
&ldquo;rich and powerful, who for a long time served in the wars under
the Frank princes.&rdquo; There was a brother, doubtless an elder
brother, called Tutin, a person &ldquo;noble among the first,&rdquo; and
perhaps the father of a nephew, Gundram, whom Rabanus mentions
as the royal chaplain of Lewis of Germany.</p>
<p>The lad Raban&mdash;&ldquo;the raven&rdquo;&mdash;took on his dark garments at
nine years of age and went to be a little shaveling monk at Fulda.
There he continued, patiently toiling on at his studies according
to the methods of a benighted time, and it is plain that he progressed
so well as to get the favor of his abbot, Ratgar. Since
Ratgar took office in 801 or 802, and Alcuin died in May, 804, it
must have been at or about the twenty-fifth year of his age that
Rabanus was directed to put himself under the care of Alcuin.
A record which has been preserved shows that in 801 our poet had
been made a deacon at Fulda, and it is natural for us to look
upon this journey to the monastic school of St. Martin at Tours
as an honor given to one who had already earned some distinction
in scholarship.</p>
<p>Be this as it may it is certain that nearly the latest work of
Alcuin&rsquo;s life was the preparation of the successor to his own ideas
who should hold high the torch of knowledge to his land and generation.
To him&mdash;though the old eyes at Tours should not see
it&mdash;was to succeed Walafrid Strabo, and to Walafrid Strabo were
to be added the scholars of St. Gall, and notably the marvellous
cripple Herman of Reichenau. Ratgar now was busy building a
great church, and architectural notions befogged his brain. But
he had built better than he was aware when he sent off Rabanus
and Hatto to sit at the feet of the man who had brought the system
of Bede the Venerable into Gaul, and who was to commit his own
enthusiasm for learning to a greater scholar than Paul Winfrid, the
Deacon.</p>
<p>This Hatto was not the infamous bishop of the Rat Tower
whom Southey has immortalized in blood-curdling verses. That
notorious prelate was indeed Abbot of Fulda and Bishop of Mainz,
but he died in 969 or 970, and the swarming rats which devoured
him for his avarice in keeping the corn from the poor owe their
original celebrity to those curious volumes, the <i>Centuries of Magdeburg</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
So far as we can discover, the Hatto who accompanied
Rabanus became neither famous nor infamous, unless it be something
to have obtained the abbacy of Fulda when his friend laid it
down.</p>
<p>In 804 Rabanus returned to Fulda. He had profited by the
instruction he had received, and was now the fittest person to be
put at the head of the school in the cloisters. To his original
name the old teacher had affixed the honorable title Maurus, and
to this again Rabanus himself added the descriptive adjective Magnentius.
So that Rabanus Maurus Magnentius is the full appellation
of the man henceforth to be styled with the largest truth,
<i>Primus Germaniae preceptor</i>. This giving of names was one of the
features of those times. Alcuin was called Albinus Flaccus, Paul
Winfrid was known as Bonifacius, and Ratbert, the advocate of
transubstantiation, became Paschasius. Besides this, the spelling
of proper names was very much at sea. Thus, to the R of
Rabanus there was prefixed or suffixed a Greek &ldquo;rough breathing,&rdquo;
making it HRabanus or Rhabanus, precisely as we some
times find HLudovicus or HLotharius.</p>
<p>It is at this time that the true skill and ability of Rabanus appear
before us. He was the first person to establish a school in
Germany which had in it the promise of modern education. He
allowed pupils to attend and be trained in the cloisters who had
no vocation for a monastic life. In point of fact he was the real
founder of the school system of Germany, and his fellow-countrymen
have not been slow to accredit him with the achievement.
His life and accomplishments have employed the pens of Buddeus,
Schwarz, Dahl, Bach, Kunstmann, Spengler, K&ouml;hler, Richter, and
other writers on the history of <i>paedagogik</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
It is beyond debate that the school at Fulda was a most remarkable place.</p>
<p>Rabanus was not the only teacher in the school. He was
assisted by his faithful friend Samuel of Worms, a fellow pupil
under Alcuin. Together these men developed and enlarged the
minds of many of the future nobles of Germany, and laid in Bible
study and in the advanced opinions which they announced, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
foundations for a nation the most scholarly of any on the earth.
In these classes were to be seen such disciples of the new learning
as Walafrid Strabo, Servatus Lupus, Einhard (who subsequently
sent thither his son Wussin), and Rudolf who wrote the life of his
preceptor.</p>
<p>Leaving the manner of that ancient school life for the present,
we are struck with astonishment at the broad and liberal tone of
the instruction. Rabanus followed Bede in providing an encyclopaedia
of human knowledge for his pupils. He entitled it <i>De
Universis</i> and based it on the previous work of Isidore of Seville.
Additionally he abridged the grammar of Priscian, a treatise which
furnished, even as late as the days of Richard Braythwaite and his
<i>Drunken Barnabee</i>, the suggestive line,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Fregi frontem Prisciani.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve broke Priscian&rsquo;s forehead mainly.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He also furnished a text-book in arithmetic, drawn mostly from
Boethius, and an etymology in which he depends to some extent
on Isidore. He utilized Bede for chronology, and Gregory for
ecclesiastical forms, and Augustine for doctrine, and Cassiodorus
for commentary and exegesis.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was free from much of the superstition of his age.
He objected to giving the liver of a mad dog to one who had
been bitten by it&mdash;that being then held a perfect cure. His letters
show an independent and almost an audacious mind. In all religious
discussion his motto was, &ldquo;When the cause is Christ&rsquo;s, the
opposition of the bad counts for naught.&rdquo; In statecraft&mdash;for
ecclesiastics were chief movers in these affairs&mdash;he held with Ludwig
the Pious. He wrote a great deal in the way of Scripture commentary,
and his intellect was of a mystical order. He delighted
in allegories, in enshrining the bones of saints and confessors, and
in making the most marvellous and intricate anagrams and arrangements
of verses and letters upon the subject of the Holy Cross,
whose praise he has elaborately set forth. Wimpfeling may
well style this production a &ldquo;wonderful and highly elaborate
work.&rdquo; It dates from the year 815, and no modern reader can
view it without dismay at its enormous expenditure of labor.</p>
<p>A man like this in the teacher&rsquo;s seat of Fulda would not be long
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
in obscuring by his manifest talents the feebler light of his abbot.
So Ratgar found, and devoted himself and his monks with mistimed
zeal to the erection of a great addition to the cloister church. He
grudged the time given to the studies of the school. He would
much prefer to have had the full control of all that was passing in
the cloisters, but this was plainly impossible. So he devised a
very satisfactory way of interrupting the success of Rabanus. He
took the books from the scholars and he even forbade them to the
teacher. This was the cause of some pathetic verses in which
Rabanus sets forth his petition for their return. &ldquo;Let thy clemency,&rdquo;
he exclaims, &ldquo;concede me books, for the poverty of knowledge
suffocates me.&rdquo; One grates his teeth in reading farther on
the words, &ldquo;Whether you do this or not, yet let the divine power
of the Omnipotent always afford you all good things and complete
a good fight with an honest course, that you may ever be with
Christ in the height of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ratgar was a tyrant; there was no doubt of that. The only
question was how long this tyranny would survive the loss of
students and the defection of the monks, who had already begun
to complain and resist. There was not any hope, however, that
this line of conduct would be materially altered, and here again we
have verses of Rabanus, lamenting in moving terms the loss of
scholars and the demoralization of the school. It is not at all
unlikely that the praises of the Holy Cross were the solace of the
poor pedagogue who had lost his favorite volumes. He could
scarcely otherwise have found the leisure for this elegant trifling.</p>
<p>The poem just mentioned is imperfect. It breaks off abruptly
and the conclusion is missing. What it may have had to do with
the outcome of Ratgar&rsquo;s tyranny we therefore cannot say, but the
times upon which the monastery had fallen were very grievous;
and in 807 there was a pestilence which depleted the list of monks
from four hundred down to one hundred and fifty, and these
must, of course, have been more pressed by the manual labor than
ever. They toiled as did Israel in bondage, and yet the end had
not come. It was a period of the worst sort of misrule, paralleled
later at Cluny and not unknown in other conventual establishments.
In 814 Rabanus was ordained priest on December 23d,
and, as is supposed, after his withdrawal for a time from the monastery
to the refuge offered by a friend&rsquo;s house. From a passage
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
in one of his commentaries it has been inferred that he used this
suspense of his labors to make a journey to Palestine.</p>
<p>In 811 there was, says Dahl, a great confusion (<i>Verwirrung</i>) in
the cloister. A libel was sent to Charles the Great criticising the
conduct of Ratgar&mdash;&ldquo;libel&rdquo; being used in its old sense of &ldquo;little
treatise.&rdquo; Nothing, as it would seem, was done about this, although
the ordination of Rabanus may have been a link in the chain.</p>
<p>But when Ludwig the Pious (Ludwig der Fromme) came to the
kingdom Ratgar was summarily deposed, and Egil, a kindly,
book-loving man, created abbot in his stead. This occurred in
817, three years after Ludwig began to reign. All difficulties were
now over. The school was reopened with greater prosperity than
before. The library was increased. The secular scholars were
taught outside the walls, for the number of students surpassed the
accommodation. And, in a word, Ratgar had merely held back
a constantly augmenting torrent which now poured itself in in an
intrepid tide. When Martin Luther, centuries later, cries out for
intelligent instruction and for the extension of the school system
of Germany, he is but repeating the cry which swelled in the ears
of Ratgar and drove him before it with execration from his abbacy.</p>
<p>In 822, when Egil died, by common consent Rabanus was invested
with the dignity of abbot. For a time things went smoothly
enough, and such scholars as Walafrid Strabo, Servatus Lupus,
and Otfried of Weissenberg were the glory of the Fulda schools.
But the pendulum swung too far in the rebound from Ratgar&rsquo;s
illiterate policy. The monks were kept at writing and teaching
with too little discrimination as to their tastes and capacities.
They began to grumble that the material interests of the monastery
were neglected, and that Fulda might be growing rich in books
and in bookworms, but was in danger of becoming poor in everything
else. The disaffection found a support in Archbishop Otgar
of Mainz, a busy political prelate, who seems to have become jealous
of the prominence of Rabanus. As a supporter of Lothar and
of the policy of imperial unity, he was in politics on the other side
from Rabanus. Our abbot was a Nationalist and a Home Ruler.
He wished to foster the cultivation of the German tongue and to
maintain the distinctness of the German nation. He had stood
by poor, weak Ludwig the Pious, whose sorrow it was to have succeeded
to the work of Charles the Great. He addressed to him a
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
letter of consolation in his troubles, and wrote a treatise: <i>De Reverentia
Filiorum erga Patres et Subditorum erga Reges</i>, to recall his
unfilial children to a sense of their duty. In Ludwig the German
he recognized the most dutiful of the three. So when the Emperor
Ludwig died in 840, he supported the younger Ludwig in the demand
for virtual German independence against the high-handed
imperialism of his elder brother Lothar. He thus shared in the
triumph of the victory at Fontanetum, followed by the Compact
of Verdun (843), which practically put an end to Karling imperialism,
and secured the national independence of France and Germany.
But in the mean time Otgar enabled the illiterate party at
Fulda to drive Rabanus into exile, and when he came back he
found the brethren had chosen another abbot, Hatto, in his stead.
Waiving his own rights, and laying aside all grudges, he betook
himself to his books in a priory or something of the sort on Mount
St. Peter, not far off, and resumed the work of teaching. Here he
is thought to have composed his great philosophical treatise on the
All, which marks a distinct advance in the development of mediaeval
metaphysics and logic. Indeed, there was but one thinker
of the ninth century who surpassed him in penetration and learning&mdash;the
wonderful Irish monk, John Scotus Erigena, who wrote
Latin but thought in Greek and was filled with all the wisdom of
the Hellenes, from Plato to Dionysius the Areopagite.</p>
<p>In 847 Archbishop Otgar died, and Ludwig the German elevated
his friend Rabanus to the see of Mainz, the metropolitan see of
Germany. Since Boniface, the Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;Apostle of Germany,&rdquo;
who had succeeded to this dignity a century earlier, there
had been no man of such eminence at the head of the German
Church, nor have any of his successors surpassed him. His first
care was the restoration of the discipline, which had decayed under
the confusions of those dark days of civil war. A great synod met
at Mainz in October, Rabanus having been consecrated in June.
Besides the prelates, abbots and monks of all orders attended, and
the canons adopted had reference to stricter life as the obligation of
the clergy.</p>
<p>The year was not over before news of fresh trouble reached him.
One of his own pupils at Fulda, the monk Gottschalk, a man of
restless intellect, was reported as spreading an exaggerated version
of Augustine&rsquo;s doctrine of absolute predestination, and one which
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
threatened to overturn the very idea of human responsibility.
Gottschalk evidently was one of the people who love to walk on
the fence rather than in the road&mdash;to carry every principle with
ruthless logic to its remotest conclusion. The first news of his
extravagances reached Rabanus in a letter from Italy setting forth
the doctrines his former pupil was teaching. He at once responded
in a letter (or rather a treatise) taking the same ground as
the semi-Pelagians had done in the controversy with the school
of Augustine, ground sanctioned by Gregory the Great, Beda,
and Alcuin, although thought unsafe when first defended by Gennadius
and John Cassian. Gottschalk seems to have accepted the
reply as a sort of challenge. The next year, 848, he made his
way to Mainz, and when Rabanus called together an assembly of
churchmen and laymen&mdash;not a regular synod&mdash;he appeared before
it with a confession of his faith in which he replied to the arguments
of Rabanus. The assembly failed to convince him of his
being in error, and at the king&rsquo;s suggestion a pledge was exacted
of him that he would never return to Germany. Hincmar of
Rheims, the metropolitan of the Church of France, made sure of
his keeping this pledge. As Gottschalk was handed over to him
by King Ludwig, with a letter of explanation from Rabanus, he
had him condemned by the Synod of Quiercy (853) to deposition
from the priesthood, corporal chastisement until he should burn
his confession with his own hands, and lifelong imprisonment.
So ended, in 867, this Calvinist of the ninth century, without
much credit to anybody who had a hand in his fate, but with least
of discredit to Rabanus.</p>
<p>In 852, by order of King Ludwig, another synod convened at
Mainz, to discuss, it is supposed, the doctrine of transubstantiation,
which Paschasius Radbertus of Corbie had been setting forth
in his treatise, <i>De Corpore et Sanguine Christi</i>. Our Rabanus resisted
the new dogma, declaring that the participation of the Lord&rsquo;s
body and blood in the sacrament is &ldquo;not carnal but spiritual.&rdquo;
Nor is this the only point of his agreement with Protestant teaching.
Especially in his assertion that the Bible is a book for every
Christian, and clear and intelligible as a rule of faith, he anticipates
Luther.</p>
<p>In 850 a great famine desolated Germany, in whose course
people were driven to the terrible deeds which sometimes characterize
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
such times. Rabanus did his possible to relieve the terrible
needs of his flock. Three hundred of these poor people were fed
daily from his resources as archbishop, and his heart went out in
pity to the multitudes he could not aid. Pitiful scenes he must
have witnessed. One poor woman fell dead as she staggered to
his threshold, with a babe at her breast. His charity was too late
to save her, but her child was rescued.</p>
<p>He lived six years more, seeing his diocese recover from the
desolation of that terrible winter, cherishing the literary and educational
work of the monasteries on the lines laid down in his <i>De
Institutione Clericorum</i>, keeping his clergy up to the ideal of the
priestly life as defined in his <i>De Disciplina Ecclesiastica</i>, and civilizing
the rude people of his great diocese. He died in 856, in his
eightieth year, and was buried in St. Alban&rsquo;s church in Mainz.
In the era of the Reformation his bones were transferred to St.
Maurice&rsquo;s church in Halle. As Rome has not inscribed the
opponent of transubstantiation in the list of her saints, they are
allowed to rest together in peace, instead of being distributed
through a long series of churches as relics.</p>
<p>He had composed for himself an epitaph, as was the fashion of
those days, but it is pleasanter to read than some of those exaggeratedly
humble and prosaic treatises concerning which we hardly
know whether most to stand amazed at the badness of the Latin
or the meanness of the piety. Rabanus avoids these objectionable
features. His language is that of a poet and his sentiments those
of a sincere Christian. Particularly there are two lines which are
notable because they give us a glimpse of his personality:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Promptus erat animus, sed tardans debile corpus;</p>
<p class="t0">Feci quod poteram, quodque Deus dederat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Quick was my mind, but slow was my body through weakness;</p>
<p class="t0">That which I could I have done, and what the Lord gave me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One of his latest bequests was that of his books, which he devised,
like a true scholar, partly to his old abbey of Fulda and
partly to the monastery of St. Alban at Mainz.</p>
<p>John Trithemius eulogizes him in words which may, perhaps,
be transferred into our pages from their original Latin as
a specimen of the praise which Rabanus has always received&mdash;praise
that is indeed worthy of the man who wrote the <i>Veni, Creator</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rabanus was first among the Germans; a scholar universally
erudite; profound in science; eloquent and strong in discourse;
in life and conversation he shone as most learned, religious, and
holy; he was always a prelate dignified, affable, and acceptable
before God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This same Trithemius gives us a little notion of the bishop&rsquo;s
appearance. In body, he says that he was tolerably robust; of a
sanguine, bilious temperament; rather fleshly in person than inclined
to meagreness (<i>macilentus</i>); with a &ldquo;courageous and great&rdquo;
head; and of a well-proportioned figure.</p>
<p>Of the other writings of Rabanus it is sufficient for us to name
his compendium of the grammar of Priscian; his great work upon
<i>The Universe</i>; his treatise upon the <i>Praises of the Holy Cross</i>,
and his elaborate commentaries upon the various books of the
Bible. He also prepared homilies and sundry compositions relative
to ecclesiastical matters. In the <i>Patrologia</i> of Migne it requires
six closely-printed volumes to cover his contributions to sacred
literature. Especially we have occasion to note his theological
writings, as it is in these that his spiritual character is most apparent.</p>
<p>His works mostly are dead enough to modern interest, but not
all. German philology honors in him a great churchman who
shared Charles the Great&rsquo;s respect for German speech and culture,
and at whose feet Otto of Weissenburg, the poet of the <i>Krist</i>, sat.
German pedagogics recognizes in him the first <i>Praeceptor Germaniae</i>,
who transplanted to Fulda the generous plans of education
which Charles conceived, and which Alcuin executed at Tours.
German philosophy recognizes in him the first forerunner of the
great series of her metaphysicians. But to us he is Rabanus the

<br /><span class="small">NOTKER OF ST. GALL, CALLED BALBULUS.</span></h2>
<p>In the life of Notker, written by Ekkehard (Eckhardt) the
Younger, who was Dean of St. Gall in 1220, we have a perfect
mine of garrulous gossip and of chattering, pleasant romance. It
has been called &ldquo;one of the most delightful of mediaeval memoirs;&rdquo;
though we are very little disposed to accept a large share of it as
solid fact. There is in it much confusion, both of dates and
names. From one of its stories came the designation of Charles the
Great (&ldquo;the Emperor Charles&rdquo;) as the author of the <i>Veni Creator</i>,
a point which we have treated more fully in the chapter upon
Rabanus Maurus. The copyist is mainly accountable for these
blunders, some of which are so grossly anachronistic as to be at
once corrected by their reader; and others are so puerile that no
one can easily be deceived.</p>
<p>Since it is to Notker that we owe the &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; in its full
development, it may be as well for us to let Ekkehard sketch his
character at full length. The biography is in one of the April
volumes of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> of the Bollandist Fathers&mdash;a great
white-covered folio which displays the immense research of its
editors. For those who are less inclined to the Latin language in
its monkish form, there is the admirable abridgment by Baring-Gould,
known as the <i>Lives of the Saints</i>&mdash;a compilation which
must be always distinguished from the work of the same title by
Alban Butler. From these sources a great deal of truth and falsehood,
fact and fiction, real record and unreal romance, have flowed
forth upon the world. We cannot but speak reverently and
kindly of such noble endeavors as those of Dr. Neale, but here,
at the very outset, it must be understood that he has been altogether
too much swayed by peculiar opinions for his ideas upon
sequences&mdash;and upon Notker also&mdash;to have the weight of absolute authority.</p>
<p>Notker himself is to be discriminated from another Notker of
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
the same religious house of St. Gall, who is generally known as
&ldquo;the Physician.&rdquo; This one is Balbulus, or &ldquo;the Stammerer,&rdquo;
who is sometimes called &ldquo;Vetustior,&rdquo; the Elder, to distinguish
him from his nephew, Notkerus Junior. He came, Ekkehard
asserts, of noble and even royal parentage, being probably born
about the year 850. At an early age he entered the monastery of
St. Gall, in Switzerland, which had been founded by Gallus, the
Irish saint, a disciple of Columbanus, in the seventh century.
This celebrated man died, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 640, at the age of ninety-five, and
his life was written by Walafrid Strabo in two books; the martyrology
recording his death upon October 16th. St. Gall itself is now
a town of some fifteen thousand inhabitants, and the capital of the
canton to which it has given its own name. But the abbey was
suppressed in 1805, though the library, filled with valuable manuscripts,
still remains. From these ancient parchments P. Gall
Morel, Librarian at Einsiedeln, has resuscitated many sequences
and hymns formerly employed in their services.</p>
<p>The Sangallensian poets are not, however, very numerous.
Hartmann was probably the earliest composer of a &ldquo;sequence&rdquo;&mdash;a
style of sacred poem which we shall consider presently. Then
came Notker Balbulus, who has the greater renown. Tutilo and
Ratpert and Walafrid Strabo complete the list. St. Gall was for
years a noted centre of learning. It is well situated, and from its
towers the waters of the Boden-See (from which it is distant but a
few miles) can be readily discerned.</p>
<p>Here, then, Notker began his religious life. He had probably
seen the light in the green and fertile Thurgau not far away from
St. Gall. And his talents were soon so noticeable that he rapidly
advanced in the esteem of his associates. Meanwhile&mdash;for the
Irish and Scottish monks made this a thoroughfare on their pilgrimages
to Rome&mdash;there came along an Irish bishop named Mark,
whose nephew, Maengal, strongly aroused the admiration of Notker.
Maengal&rsquo;s music especially affected him, and he devoutly prayed
God to let the Irishman tarry with them at St. Gall. This indeed
happened, and Maengal, rechristened Marcellus, remained
in Switzerland.</p>
<p>This good tutor now undertook the musical training of Notker,
Ratpert, and Tutilo. And from this beginning arose the choral
school of St. Gall. Ekkehard&rsquo;s history of it is most suggestive.
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
It was originally begun, he says, for the study of the Gregorian
tones, but these Swiss people had by degrees lost the sweetness of
the old Pope&rsquo;s music. And he borrows the language of John the
Deacon, in his life of Gregory, to satirize the &ldquo;thundering voices&rdquo;
with which such &ldquo;Alpine bodies&rdquo; failed to secure the proper
modulation. I borrow Baring-Gould&rsquo;s idiomatic rendering of this
significant passage. It runs as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The barbarous hugeness of those tippling throats, when endeavoring
to utter a soft song full of inflections and diphthongs,
makes a great roar, as though carts were tumbling down steps
headlong; and so, instead of soothing the minds of those who
listen, it agitates and exasperates them beyond endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the character of church music when the song school of
St. Gall was started. The monks had already been so fortunate as to
secure one of the two Gregorian antiphonaries sent by Pope Adrian
to the Emperor Charles the Great. The occurrence was curious
enough to be chronicled, and the story merits our own repetition.
Metz had been the German music centre, but when the French
music clashed with that which was considered the correct and
Gregorian method, Charles again solicited from the Pope two
priests who were thorough musicians, and should put Metz and
her school above criticism. These two men, by name Peter
and Romanus, set out thereupon, but took a heavy cold between
them at Lago Maggiore (<i>aere Romanis contrario quaterentur</i>).
Peter soon recovered, but Romanus advanced from a mere cold
into an actual fever, and remained at St. Gall with one of the
antiphonaries, while the disgusted Peter, who claimed both copies,
was forced to proceed alone and with a single manuscript to
Metz.</p>
<p>St. Gall was sufficiently attractive to Romanus for him to make
no effort to leave it when he grew convalescent. And these compositions
and melodies of his were the foundation upon which, in
later years, Notker and Hartmann and the others built their
sequences. That which Maengal now effected was the real beginning
of that system of music which is so elaborately treated by Dr.
Neale in his preface to the second volume of Daniel&rsquo;s <i>Thesaurus</i>.
Perhaps more has been made of it there than it really deserves.
It is certainly too far out of the line of this inquiry of ours for us
to discuss the point technically. One of the best definitions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
the sequence is, however, that of Mabillon, who calls such compositions
&ldquo;rhythmical prayers&rdquo; (<i>rythmicae preces</i>).</p>
<p>Notker became easily&mdash;so Ekkehard asserts&mdash;the finest musician
about the abbey. He was also a bright and rather witty man.
When Augustine was asked what God was doing before He created
the world, he replied that He &ldquo;was building hell for such vain
and frivolous spirits&rdquo; as that of his questioner. The chaplain of
Charles the Fat put a similar inquiry to Notker, and got quite as
brief a retort. He asked, &ldquo;What is God doing now?&rdquo; And
Notker stammered out, &ldquo;Just what He has always done and
always will do; He is putting down the proud and exalting the
humble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another of these queer anecdotes which will serve to
show that the old monks were by no means destitute of a sense of
humor. A certain young Salomon, son of the Count of Ramsweg,
was a student of the abbey school, and something of a snob among
his fellow-scholars. Notker, Ratpert, Tutilo and Hartmann were
of as good family as he, and they did not enjoy his behavior.
Finally, through favoritism, Salomon came to be abbot of six
monasteries and Bishop of Constance in addition. But in spite
of these dignities he had a singular predilection for the Abbey of
St Gall, and was accustomed to put on a surplice and go about
the place attending the offices like a regular monk&mdash;which, by the
way, he had no right to do. His old friends found this out, and
raised so much of a stir about it that he ceased from the practice.
But at night he still persisted in entering the abbey and aiding in
the services.</p>
<p>Rudiger, one of the confederates, was therefore set to watch for
the coming of the intruding bishop, and when Salomon slipped
along toward the church in the darkness the watcher suddenly
thrust a light in his face and saw who it was. Then this valiant
Rudiger swore the largest oath permitted in those sacred precincts,
for he asseverated &ldquo;by St. Gall&rdquo; that no stranger in their conventual
habit should be around the cloisters at night. Salomon
offered endless apologies, and promised to secure permission from
the abbot before he wore the surplice again. And he even turned
his discomfiture into a partial victory by begging Rudiger to present
this request in his behalf. The petition, so voiced, came
duly before the &ldquo;senate&rdquo; of that monkish republic, which happened,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
unfortunately for the avaricious and rapacious Salomon,
to include his four opposers&mdash;&ldquo;Hartmann, who composed the
melody to the <i>Sanctus humili prece</i>; Notker the Stammerer, who
made <i>Sequences</i>; Ratpert, who wrote <i>Ardua spes mundi</i>, and Tutilo,
who was the author of <i>Hodie cantandus</i>.&rdquo; These men finally
allowed him to come in as usual, provided he would entirely
demit his canon&rsquo;s raiment, and be nothing but a Benedictine monk
while within the walls.</p>
<p>Somehow Salomon conceded even this, and one day brought a
splendid gift&mdash;a gold box encrusted with jewels and containing
relics&mdash;which he offered to the abbey. All this looked in the
direction that the monks feared; and they therefore rejected his
present with some scorn. But it did not take long to lift Salomon
the Simonist to the Abbacy of Reichenau, and then Archbishop
Sfortto contrived at length to secure the wealthy St. Gall for his
favorite. Thus Salomon, the detested, became, in spite of all
opposition, the abbot of that celebrated cloister.</p>
<p>But St. Gall itself had always prospered, apparently as the sun
does according to the theories of some astronomers, for it had
been continually receiving cometary accessions that dropped into
it unexpectedly. One such was an antiphonary, which, on the
principle that &ldquo;to him that hath shall be given,&rdquo; fell into the
hands of these musical monks through the burning of the Abbey of
Jumieges in 851. This was the true origin of the &ldquo;sequence.&rdquo;
It solved the problem of Notker in a novel manner when he finally
examined it, for he had been puzzled at the immense prolongation
of the final syllable <i>ia</i> in the <i>Alleluia</i>, which was sung to cover the
retreat of the deacon as he ascended to the rood-loft to chant the
Gospel. This <i>Alleluia</i> came between the Epistle and the Gospel,
and as the deacon had some space to traverse, the <i>ia</i> was nearly
interminable; for even a very few seconds became on such an occasion
a most perceptible and wearisome interval of time.</p>
<p>This Jumieges antiphonary, in which words were fitted to the
Gregorian tones, suggested another treatment of the difficulty. Notker
consequently composed the <i>Laudes Deo concinat</i>, and afterward
the <i>Coluber Adae male suasor</i>. Iso, his master, approved of them,
and Maengal afterward gave him considerable help. The &ldquo;sequence&rdquo;
in its standard form had a &ldquo;note to each syllable,&rdquo; as in
modern church music. And this was the beginning of that Book
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
of Sequences perfected by him in 887, and which has gained a
merited prominence for the name of Notker Balbulus.</p>
<p>Ekkehard tells certain legends (which may or may not be trustworthy)
regarding the suggestion whence some of these sprung.
The droning rotation of a slow mill-wheel gave rise, he says, to the
sequence <i>Sancti Spiritus adsit nobis gratia</i>; and this is far more
credible than the additional information that Notker sent it to
&ldquo;the Emperor&rdquo; Charles and got back the famous <i>Veni Creator
Spiritus</i>&mdash;a story which Mabillon utterly confutes. This Emperor
was certainly <i>not</i> Charles the Great&mdash;who was long ago dead&mdash;and it
<i>might</i> have been Charles &ldquo;the Bald&rdquo; or Charles &ldquo;the Fat&rdquo; (the
usurper), or Charles &ldquo;the Simple,&rdquo; but there seems an antecedent
improbability that any such nickname could belong to the grave
and great poet of that splendid hymn. And, indeed, we are now
positive that it is the composition of Rabanus Maurus, Bishop of
Mayence (Mainz), who died in 856.</p>
<p>There is probably some show of reason in the idea that the
groaning machinery of a mill should have helped to originate the
extended notes of the sequence. The picturesqueness of the
story is really its best claim to our notice. I well remember a
mill by which I used often to pause in the stillness of night, listening
to the wailing protracted cadences of the huge wheel which
slowly turned in its bed as the buckets successively filled from the
shut, but leaky gates. Hearing this, and comparing it with the
&ldquo;sequence&rdquo; of the Catholic service, or with the long-drawn tones
of a German choral, it is impossible not to be struck by the
resemblance.</p>
<p>Then there is another story&mdash;indeed, there are several in the
Latin which could scarcely be inserted here&mdash;but there is certainly
one other which both Baring-Gould and Maitland have had sufficient
geniality to extract. It refers to the manner in which Notker,
Ratpert, and Tutilo&mdash;&ldquo;the three inseparables&rdquo;&mdash;attended to the
eavesdropping of one of Abbot Salomon&rsquo;s spies. This spy was
Sindolf, the <i>refectorarius</i>, or steward, a sour-visaged, crab-appleish
kind of man, who was never so happy as when he had an evil
speech to retail. He particularly delighted in fretting the temper
of the abbot with reference to these poets and musicians, but they
suspected his design and &ldquo;set a watch because of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One evening after &ldquo;lauds&rdquo; the three were in the &ldquo;writing-room&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
(<i>scriptorium</i>) where the manuscripts were prepared and
kept, busy with their conversation and having thereto the permission
of the prior. Sindolf sniffed scandal in the air, and flattened
his ear against the opaque glass, where a convenient crack suffered
him to listen to their words. It was night, and Tutilo, a shrewd,
lively fellow (<i>homo pervicax</i>), was glad enough to get this occasion
against the slinking traitor. In the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, and again in
Mabillon, copied into the one hundred and thirty-first volume of
Migne, we have old Ekkehard&rsquo;s grim report of this monkish fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is with his ear to the glass,&rdquo; cried Tutilo. &ldquo;Do
you, Notker, because you are a timid little chap (<i>timidulus</i>), go
away into the church. But Ratpert, my friend, take down the
whip that hangs in the chimney corner and run out-doors. And
then comfort my heart (<i>cor meum confortare</i>) by laying on to him
with all your might (<i>esto robustus</i>). For I, when you get close
enough, will throw open the window in a hurry, catch him by the
hair and hang on with a will&rdquo; (<i>ad me pertractum violenter tenebo</i>).
Off went the timorous Notker; out slipped the cheerful Ratpert;
open went the window, and the vigorous Tutilo clutched Sindolf
by ears and hair together! Then Ratpert rained on the lashes
(<i>a dorso ingrandinat</i>), and Sindolf twisted and howled and kicked,
and lights began to fly around, and the brethren came running.
But Tutilo held on and called for a light and shouted that he had
caught the devil; while Ratpert vanished into the night and
Notker had entirely disappeared in the church. &ldquo;Where are
Notker and Ratpert?&rdquo; was the first question. &ldquo;Oh, they smelled
the devil and ran away to ask succor from heaven,&rdquo; said Tutilo.
&ldquo;And here was I, left to do the best I could with this thing that
walks in darkness. And I believe an angel has been sent to
chastise him in the rear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sneaky Sindolf was completely abashed, but his temper did
not improve under the chastisement. Even Salomon, his patron,
laughed at him along with the others, which made the matter
worse. So one day, finding a beautiful copy of the Canonical
Epistles in Greek which Liutward, Bishop of Vercelli, had sent as
a present to Notker, what does the malicious wretch do but cut it
to pieces with his knife! Ekkehard adds that the mutilated copy
could still be seen in the library of St. Gall.</p>
<p>These two worthies, Ratpert and Tutilo, heartily deserve the
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
place which Ekkehard accords them in his life of Notker. Ratpert
walked usually between Notker and Tutilo; a very punctual,
studious man who &ldquo;wore out two pairs of shoes in the year;&rdquo; a
man who seldom left the abbey walls, and who regarded &ldquo;expeditions&rdquo;
as being to the full &ldquo;as dangerous as kisses;&rdquo; a negligent
fellow about the offices and masses, claiming that he taught them
often enough to his pupils; and finally, a composer of good
litanies; dying October 25th, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 900.</p>
<p>Tutilo was a capital companion; genial and ingenious; capable
of music on all sorts of pipes and fiddles; who told a good story
and made many a good joke; active and agile in his figure, and
withal a fine carver, painter, and goldsmith. Some of his ivory
carving still exists in the town library of St. Gall&mdash;so one historian
records in a foot-note&mdash;and he was evidently a most skilful musician,
whose hymn tunes, composed on the <i>rota</i>, or small harp
(the minstrel&rsquo;s instrument in those days), were always acceptable.
He wrote <i>Hodie cantandus</i>, <i>Omnium virtutum gemmis</i>, and <i>Viri
Galilaei</i>. This last he sent to &ldquo;King Charles,&rdquo; who himself composed
a tune to which Tutilo set words called <i>Quoniam Dominus</i>.
His royal patron liked him well. &ldquo;Curse the man,&rdquo; he said one
day, &ldquo;he is altogether too good a fellow to be a monk!&rdquo; Ekkehard
adds to this list of compositions the sequence <i>Gaudete et cantate</i>
as a specimen of Tutilo&rsquo;s ability in a slightly different direction
of music, declaring that &ldquo;any one who understands music&rdquo; will
notice and appreciate the distinction.</p>
<p>Hartmann was abbot after Salomon; a most learned man, and
one who perhaps contributed more to the development of the
&ldquo;sequence&rdquo; than we are now able to prove.</p>
<p>Of Notker it is only fair to say that he gave to himself the name
<i>Balbus</i>, or Stammerer, which was changed, owing apparently to
his small stature, into the diminutive, <i>Balbulus</i>. When Innocent
III. asked Uadalric, then Abbot of St. Gall, what rank Notker
had held in the convent, the abbot replied that he was only &ldquo;a
simple monk,&rdquo; but was born of noble parents and was thoroughly
holy and well educated. On which the Pope declared that they
were wretched and wicked people (<i>nequissimi</i>), and would suffer
for it (<i>infelices eritis</i>) if they did not celebrate the festival of this
man who had been &ldquo;so full of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Julius II.
commanded Hugo, Bishop of Constance, to inquire into the matter.
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
The result established him as a beatified confessor, and so distinguished
him by the prefix &ldquo;Blessed&rdquo; from Notker &ldquo;the Abbot,&rdquo;
who was his nephew, and died 973; Notker &ldquo;the Physician,&rdquo;
who died 1033; Notker &ldquo;of Liege,&rdquo; who died 1007, and Notker
&ldquo;Labeo,&rdquo; who died 1022. B. Notker Balbulus himself died in
912. Salomon, who was then his abbot, died in 919, and in 921
Hartmann succeeded to the dignity.</p>
<p>It would not be difficult to add to this account several superstitious
stories; how Notker broke his staff over a dog-devil which
went howling through the church; how he had some difficulty
with another demon who intermeddled with pen and ink; how
he severely handled a flagitious monk; and, generally, how he
proved to be a moderate worker of miracles and a pleasant colleague
to the other cenobites.</p>
<p>But we turn with a peculiar interest to that little sequence which
has made his name immortal. This <i>Media vita in morte sumus</i> is
the one which meets us in the Burial Service of the Protestant
Episcopal Church:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In the midst of life we are in death:</p>
<p class="t">Of whom may we seek for succor</p>
<p class="t0">But of thee, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t">Who for our sins art justly displeased?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is there found in connection with a passage from the Book of
Job, and is followed by the <i>Sancte Deus; Sancte fortis; Sancte
et misericors Salvator, Amarae morti ne tradas nos</i>; which is in
our translation, &ldquo;Yet, O Lord most holy, O Lord most mighty,
O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter
pains of eternal death.&rdquo; All that Notker originally composed is
that which is first mentioned above. The rest came about as we
shall presently see.</p>
<p>The Rev. F. Proctor, in his <i>History of the Book of Common
Prayer</i>, states that this brief sequence&mdash;of which he does not
appear to know the origin&mdash;&ldquo;was formed from an antiphon which
was sung at Compline during a part of Lent.&rdquo; There is also a
singular misapprehension by which the &ldquo;samphire gatherers&rdquo;
hanging over the cliffs of England at their &ldquo;dreadful trade&rdquo; were
credited with the suggestion. It was formerly supposed that
Notker watched them during their dangerous toil, and so, by another
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
equally strange inadvertence, the fact was taken as a proof
that he must have been himself a native or resident of Britain.
This, like the other legend of the twenty-year debate upon
sequences, proves on inquiry to have no foundation in fact. The
story itself is a sufficient explanation without any coloring whatever.
It reveals to us the poetic spirit of the devout man who
beheld his fellow-creatures poised between life and death, and
wrote this short and exquisite meditation thereon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The holy Notker,&rdquo; says Canisius, &ldquo;made the &lsquo;prose&rsquo; of the
following lament when the bridge [over the chasm] at Martinstobel
was being constructed in a precipitous and most dangerous place.
But who added the &lsquo;verses&rsquo; I do not know. I have quoted it
from a most ancient codex, where it is set to modern notes.&rdquo; He
then proceeds to give it in the ordinary form. It is, as he says, a
<i>prose</i>, and must be distinguished from <i>verses</i> of regular metre:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Media vita in morte sumus, quem quaerimus adjutorem,
nisi te, Domine, qui pro peccatis nostris juste irasceris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus far Notker. Then occur the &ldquo;verses&rdquo; in three stanzas:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ah homo, perpende fragilis,</p>
<p class="t0">Mortalis, et instabilis,</p>
<p class="t0">Quod vitare non poteris</p>
<p class="t0">Mortem, quocunque ieris.</p>
<p class="t0">Aufert te, saepissime,</p>
<p class="t0">Dum vivis libentissime.</p>
<p class="t2">Sancte deus.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Vae calamitas inediae,</p>
<p class="t0">Vermis fremit invidiae,</p>
<p class="t0">Dum audit flentem animam</p>
<p class="t0">Mortalis esse utinam!</p>
<p class="t0">Nec Christi fati gladius,</p>
<p class="t0">Transiret, et non alius,</p>
<p class="t2">Sancte fortis.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Heu nil valet nobilitas</p>
<p class="t0">Neque sedis sublimitas,</p>
<p class="t0">Nil generis potentia,</p>
<p class="t0">Nil rerum affluentia,</p>
<p class="t0">Plus pura conscientia</p>
<p class="t0">Valet mundi scientia.</p>
<p class="t0">Sancte et misericors Salvator,</p>
<p class="t2">Amarae morti ne tradas nos.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>It is perfectly plain, then, that this &ldquo;third sequence&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>Media
vita</i> being the second&mdash;is derived from the &ldquo;verses&rdquo; whose authorship
Canisius cannot discover, and the date of which cannot be far
from the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>But when we imagine the good monk watching the workmen
from the brink of the Goldach, which hurries down through St.
Gall toward the Boden-See, we can bring to mind the whole picture.
The present bridge is one hundred and sixteen feet long
and fully one hundred in height from the swift little stream. It is
of wood, and was constructed in 1468. Here, dizzily balancing
in mid-air, tradition says that a man, even as Notker gazed, lost
his footing and plunged into the abyss. The eternities came
together! A spark from the infinite kindled within the poet&rsquo;s
soul. Heaven from on high beheld this single life suddenly
hurled to ruin. Earth from beneath reached up and seized upon
the thing of earth. And thus it was with us every moment! In
the midst of life we were in death, and from none could we seek
for help save from God alone&mdash;that God, displeased at sinners,
who is the sinner&rsquo;s only hope!</p>
<p>Standing once before the graves at Gettysburg, the tall gaunt
figure of Abraham Lincoln paused upon such an eternal edge.
His soul took in at one sweep the heroic past and the historic
future. And those words which came, so men assure us, almost
without premeditation from his lips are the noblest utterance of
our time. That compact, terse, brief expression is the essence of
national strength. The phrases are vivid with a supernatural
brightness: &ldquo;Government of the people, for the people, by the
people must not perish from the earth.&rdquo; It was so with Notker;
and now, wherever that beautiful service is uttered above the dead,
the forgotten monk of St. Gall speaks with a voice which touches
unaltering humanity, and utters that grave, great thought, preciously
protected in its small casket of language, that death is beneath and
God is above, and that all our hope must come from Him!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">WALAFRID STRABO.</span></h2>
<p>Among the pupils of Rabanus Maurus was a boy afflicted with
strabismus. He was cross-eyed, or crooked-eyed in some manner,
and this fixed upon him the name of Strabo the &ldquo;squinter.&rdquo;
Like many another monk in that age, he has so sunk himself into
his service as to have become a man without a country and almost
without parentage. Some therefore contend that he was an Anglo-Saxon,
once a monk in London and afterward educated at St.
Gall, Reichenau, and Fulda. An obscure tradition even makes
him a relative of the Venerable Bede. Another story assigns him
to Haymo&rsquo;s family. Now, Haymo was a monk of Fulda about
850, a man of very liberal opinions, learned, and truly catholic,
especially in his denial of the universal authority of the Pope and
the doctrine of transubstantiation. It is something of an honor
to have been this man&rsquo;s brother, and it is no discredit to have been
related to Bede. At any rate these guesses&mdash;for they are little else&mdash;serve
to show us the repute in which Walafrid Strabo was held.</p>
<p>More accurate investigation reveals a sentence in the preface to
the life of St. Gall which seems conclusive. In it Walafrid speaks
of &ldquo;us Germans or Suabians.&rdquo; Suabia is thus designated as his
birthplace, and we find his name among the list of those scholars
who did credit to their teacher Rabanus.</p>
<p>His period is the middle of the ninth century, for in 842 he
became Abbot of Reichenau in the diocese of Constance, and he
died in 849. Dates like these are not hard to verify, for we have
many chronicles and records in which the Dark Ages laid the
foundations of authentic history. Here lie away in their narrow
niches of brief reference many illustrious people. And the work
of the hymnologist consists often enough in the same sort of research
as secular history demands. Now and then on the dead
breast there is a little withered flower ready to crumble into dust.</p>
<p>That curious, peering Trithemius&mdash;to whom we are indebted
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
for such laborious inquiries concerning the men of this time&mdash;maintains
that Walafrid was &ldquo;rector&rdquo; of the school in the monastery
of Hirschfeld. If this be so it only confirms what we note
again and again, that Alcuin and Rabanus were the real instigators
of German scholarship. And the work from which we shall presently
quote becomes more interesting to us for this reason.</p>
<p>Walafrid left a long catalogue of works behind him. He wrote
a valuable antiquarian treatise on the divine offices and usages
of the Church. Besides, he is accredited as the author of the lives
of St. Gall, St. Othmar, St. Blaithmac, St. Mamma, and St. Leudegaris.
He also composed various poems; a preface to the
Life of Ludwig the Pious, and a condensation of Rabanus
Maurus&rsquo;s Commentary on Leviticus. He compiled the famous
<i>Glossa Ordinaria</i>, which remained the standard commentary on
the Bible throughout the Middle Ages. He began the annals of
Fulda, which have since been continued by competent hands,
notably those of Christopher Brower. He has been called a
&ldquo;pretty good poet for his age&rdquo;&mdash;by which is meant that there was a
scanty supply of poetry in the ninth century&mdash;a fact which no one
is competent to dispute.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that his life was the life of an ecclesiast,
restricted to a Chinese minuteness of ritual, and permitting only
such visits and journeys as religious business justified. His death
occurred on one of these infrequent expeditions. It was in
France, whither he had gone&mdash;as we are expressly told&mdash;in order
to hasten some ecclesiastical affair.</p>
<p>These are the meagre and unentertaining facts connected with
the name of Walafrid Strabo. He would not have deserved, nor
would he have received our notice if two of his hymns (the
<i>Laudem beatae martyris</i> and the <i>Gloriam nato cecinere</i>) had not
been preserved. These entitle him to mention, and he promptly
rises to genuine importance if we can agree with Kellner (see
<i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>, January, 1883, p. 154), that a recently discovered
&ldquo;diary&rdquo; is from his pen. It is probable that, whether it be
authentic or not, it is strictly accurate in its relation of the studies
pursued in those schools. And if we assume it to be credible we
can revise our dates to correspond.</p>
<p>Thus his school life began in 816, and after its close he went to
Fulda, thence to return to his old monastery in 842 as its abbot.
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
These dates are afforded by the document itself, which was originally
published in 1857, as a part of the educational report of the
Benedictine school of St. Maria of Einsiedeln in Switzerland. It
appears to me that its tone and composition are not such as to
justify the value which Kellner sets upon it. Walafrid&rsquo;s name
was a convenient one, and this is doubtless no more nor less than
a clever historical romance. But it has been composed in the
very neighborhood of the scenes it depicts, and the advantages of
all the ancient <span class="small">MSS.</span> and traditions have been incalculably great.</p>
<p>The narrative is introduced by a modern preface which speaks
of St. Meinrad, the founder of Einsiedeln, as a contemporary of
Walafrid. Then we have a statement which tersely exhibits the
plan and purpose of the story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the dark hour when the Roman imperial throne collapsed
on which Theodoric the Goth had just seated his teacher Avitus,
Manlius Boethius committed his spiritual wealth to the Goth
Cassiodorus, who transmitted it to the sons of St. Benedict,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seed of Christian instruction had been inherited by the sons
of St. Benedict from the age of martyrs and holy fathers. Great
seminaries were opened at Fulda, Weissenberg in the bishopric
of Speyer, St. Alban in Mainz, St. Gall, Reichenau in the bishopric
of Constance, St. Maximin, and St. Matthias in Trier, etc.
To these establishments the sons of the nobility resorted, while the
Benedictines were their teachers and fathers. Whoever saw one
of these schools saw them all as to everything essential. Accordingly,
it is our purpose to describe one of them&mdash;namely, the school
of Reichenau, from which came the founder of Einsiedeln, St.
Meinrad, and Walafrid Strabo, who was his schoolmate in
Reichenau, and who, four years after him, assumed the Benedictine dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follows an assurance to the &ldquo;intelligent reader&rdquo; that this
account &ldquo;is not mere poetry,&rdquo; but is &ldquo;sustained by authoritative
documents,&rdquo; among which are named the writings of Walafrid
himself, of Bede, Alcuin, Rabanus, and the collections of Pez,
Metzler, and others. It is plain, then, that Kellner has been misled,
and that Professor J. D. Butler, of Madison, Wis., who has
made this clever translation from the German, has been likewise
deceived. Yet the historical importance of the &ldquo;diary&rdquo; remains,
and the writings of Alcuin, Bede, and Rabanus, with those of
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
Walafrid, give the original particulars and can be cited in proof.
Professor Butler adds a few pleasant details about Reichenau. It
was founded in 724, earlier than any neighboring convent except
St. Gall. It is on an island in the Lake of Constance, whose
lake-girt limits are about two miles by three. It became so rich
that it acquired many other properties, and its abbot could journey
to Rome and never sleep a night outside of his own domain.
The old tower, built by Henry the Black, is still standing, and
among the cherished relics of the abbey is a piece of green glass
weighing twenty-eight pounds given by Charlemagne, who thought
it to be an emerald. There is also a supposititious water-pot from
Cana of Galilee, which evidently came from Palestine and shows
the mediaeval intercourse with the Holy Land. The revenues of
the abbey were not sequestrated until the year 1799. Such is a
brief sketch of this religious house which we shall again encounter
in the story of Hermannus Contractus.</p>
<p>Walafrid&rsquo;s narrative begins with the year 815. He saw the vast
buildings with surprise and was greeted by a throng of future
schoolmates. His teacher had several boys under his care to teach
them to read. This he did by the help of a wax tablet&mdash;the old
Roman method. The letters were scratched on the wax and
erased by the blunt end of the pointed &ldquo;style.&rdquo; Along with this
elementary work came Latin, together with a German primer&mdash;in
both of which the boys were expected to read.</p>
<p>At harvest time there was a short vacation. The boys rambled
through the fields and picked fruit and enjoyed themselves
generally.</p>
<p>The second year&rsquo;s work was the learning of conversational Latin.
This was the language of daily intercourse and was employed to
express all wants. The grammar of Donatus was studied under a
pupil-teacher, and the cases and tenses were rigidly committed to
memory. The rod was the penalty for misbehavior. German
phrases were translated into Latin and some portion of biblical
history was repeated to the scholars at night, which they were
obliged to tell again in the morning.</p>
<p>Then follows a description of the dedication of the minster and
of the solemn effect of the great High Mass, at which time Walafrid
resolves to become a monk.</p>
<p>The year 817 was occupied with grammar and orthography, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
the use of Latin was compulsory. Hitherto there had been a
trifle of laxity and a few lapses into German were forgiven. Now
there was no exception to scholars of this advancement. They
wrote from dictation upon their tablets, and the Psalter was in this
manner transcribed and memorized.</p>
<p>The fourth year (818) was signalized by the planting of the first
grape-vine on the island. Doubtless the fact itself is authentic,
and is here introduced owing to its date. And in this year the
scholars attack prosody. They study Alcuin (who wrote many
verses), and the distichs of Cato, and Bede&rsquo;s <i>De Arte Metrica</i>.
The earlier Christian poets&mdash;Prosper and Juvencus and Sedulius&mdash;are
mentioned. It is strange that the author does not name Prudentius,
who was far more of a classic than any or all of these
three. But it is quite correct to mention Virgil as a permitted
book, and the exercises in poetry in which all were engaged.</p>
<p>In 819, the fifth year, the boys became pupil-teachers themselves.
They were further instructed in rhetoric, with illustrations from
the Bible to be paralleled from Statius and Lucan, whose works
they were studying. Other scholars again were set to work as
scribes and copyists. The amusements were the running of foot-races,
quarter-staff playing, and &ldquo;dice,&rdquo; by which we are probably
to understand the very ancient game of backgammon. And
again, it is strange that no mention is made of the games of ball,
which were decidedly common in those days.</p>
<p>The year 820 is consumed with rhetoric&mdash;with Cicero, Quintilian,
and the histories of Bede, Eusebius, Jerome, and others.
The classic authors were Sallust and Livy, with Virgil and (at last)
Prudentius and Fortunatus.</p>
<p>In 821 comes Boethius, attended by more of Cassiodorus, and
the pleasant pastime of &ldquo;dialectics,&rdquo; or debating. In these
debates the enthusiasm was kindled for future controversies. And
in other lines&mdash;as, for example, in studies of the current legal
codes, of the Salic and Ripuarian Franks and Lombards&mdash;those
who were to be rulers were diligently trained. Here (for this is
the exact account of that ancient instruction) we see how the
Church held sway over her former pupils, and how the pupils
became by and by the exponents of religious opinions and subservient
to ecclesiastical decrees.</p>
<p>With 822 we have mention of rhetoric and logic, with oral and
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
written exercises, and in 823 the scholars took up and pursued
the studies of geometry and geography according to the light of
that period. Then came music with the various instruments, as
organ, harp, flute, or trombone. Finally, Walafrid is supposed
to record his initiation into the reading of Greek. From the <span class="small">MS.</span>
of Homer the boys were instructed, and the account closes abruptly
with a reference to the study of astronomy.</p>
<p>Subsequent to this year, 825, Walafrid is believed to have passed
considerable time at Fulda with Rabanus Maurus.</p>
<p>These were the ideas and educational methods of that period.
Outside of the monasteries and abbeys there was nothing that
went on in the way of learning. It needed special establishments,
with great wealth, the protection of kings and nobles, and
the indefinable terrors of religious authority to perpetuate scholarship.
We may despise, as some writers freely do despise, the
bigotry and intolerance which obliterated fine manuscripts of the
classics to make room for monkish trifles. But we cannot fail to
discover the germs of the new poetry of the Church in these unpromising
times. Fortunatus and Prudentius were no bad preceptors
after all. And even if Walafrid Strabo was not much of a
poet, he has served our occasion as a pupil when he might not
have gained notice as a writer of hymns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">HERMANNUS CONTRACTUS AND THE &ldquo;VENI SANCTE SPIRITUS.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>One of the surprises of history is the long-delayed honor which
comes to the modest and the meek. The notable and prominent
attract to themselves much of the repute of any age. They even
gain the credit of achievements to which they never put a finger.
But by and by the &ldquo;whirligig of time brings in his revenges,&rdquo;
and they that were last become first.</p>
<p>Thoughts like these are sure to come to us when we encounter
such a name as this of the poor cripple of Reichenau. Whatever
fame he had in his own day gradually disappeared and he has
been only a shadowy figure for many years. It is true that Ersch
and Gruber, in their great encyclopaedia, say of him that he is
&ldquo;one of the most meritorious men of the eleventh century.&rdquo; It is
also true that Ussermann&mdash;himself an almost forgotten authority&mdash;has
labored to give Hermann his proper meed of praise; and
that the Benedictines have patiently collated many little particulars
concerning him. Yet he still remains locked up in Latin or in
German or in French; and English readers can be pardoned for
being utterly ignorant of him and of his works.</p>
<p>This man merits no small share of our notice. He came of
good blood, for his father was the Count of V&ouml;hringen in Suabia.
He traced his kinship to the famous St. Udalric, whose sister,
named Leutgarde, is mentioned (971) in the saintly bishop&rsquo;s
pages. Her son was Reginbald, slain in battle against the Hungarians
in 955. This Reginbald had a daughter Bertha, who married
Wolfrad, Count of V&ouml;hringen, and died in 1032. Wolfrad,
dying in 1010, had a son Wolfrad, who married a lady named
Hiltrude and became the father of fifteen children&mdash;one of whom
was Hermann. This is the simplest form of a genealogy, which
the learned chronicler protracts in a marvellous manner, to the
great confusion of the modern mind. I have not cared to follow
him into the remoter affinities and alliances which add distinction
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
to the poor little paralytic child, who at seven years of age was
carried to the great school at St. Gall.</p>
<p>I have said that Hermann was a cripple. He was so completely
helpless, indeed, that he could not move without assistance; and
his days and nights were full of pain. He was &ldquo;hump-backed
and bow-breasted, crippled and lame.&rdquo; (<i>Gibosus ante et retro, et
contractus, claudus</i>. Pertz: <i>Monumenta: Scriptores:</i> V., 268.)
But his mind triumphed over these infirmities. A pathetic legend
concerning him assures us that in the visions of the night the
Virgin stood before him, radiant and beautiful. As in the old
story about the choice of Hercules&mdash;which was probably the origin
of this&mdash;she offers him strength of body combined with ignorance
and weakness of mind; or wisdom and ability in a body which
should be deficient and sickly to the day of his death. This
&ldquo;second Hercules&rdquo;&mdash;as the chronicler admiringly calls him&mdash;promptly
chose the last.</p>
<p>He had been born (for his ancestral records and his own <i>Chronicon</i>
help us to exactness) on July 18th, 1013. He was admitted
to school, probably, though not certainly, at St. Gall, on September
15th, 1020. Hitherto his education had been absolutely
neglected. He could not go about alone nor even speak intelligibly
(<i>Annales Augustani</i> [1042-55]. In Pertz: <i>Mon. Ger.</i>,
VII., 126) owing to his paralysis. But he had a devouring desire
for knowledge, and rapidly mastered Latin, Greek, Arabic, and
(probably) Hebrew, so that he possessed them equally well with
his vernacular speech. The convent was the only place for such a
poor little waif as he, and thus, within the learned cloisters of St.
Gall, he followed reverently upon the shining path of Notker and
Tutilo and Ratpert and Hartmann, and added his name to theirs
in the development of the sequences and antiphons of the
Church.</p>
<p>Nor was this all. He became an excellent historian, a distinguished
musician, and a renowned philosopher and theologian.
In mathematics he was equally skilled and ingenious. He is considered
by some to have invented the astrolabe, the first instrument
by which the height and distances of stars were calculated. Assuredly
he wrote an exhaustive treatise upon its use, whether he
originated it or not; and it is said that he added to his scientific
studies the making of clocks and watches. He has left us essays
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
upon the monochord, on the squaring of the circle, on computation
and physiognomy and metrical rules and astronomy. These
are marked by the inferior attainments of the age, as we might expect,
but they display an amount of original research for which
we are unprepared.</p>
<p>He was also an excellent scribe, and the library of St. Gall still
contains a copy of a work ascribed to Anselm of Canterbury
written by him in the fulfilment of a vow. He resembled the
Venerable Bede in the universality of his knowledge, and, like
Alcuin and Rabanus Maurus, he is one of the great teachers of his
time. Always, during these darkening years, there appears to
have been some ministering priest in the temple of education&mdash;some
self-devoted, God-fearing man, who patiently kept the altar-fire
burning, and spent his life, to the utmost verge, in climbing
those altar-steps with fresh fuel for the flame.</p>
<p>We do not know how much of this work was begun or completed
during his life at St. Gall. We are able to say that he
translated Aristotle&rsquo;s Poetics and Rhetoric from the Arabic language,
and this of itself should award to him the very highest renown.
It is impossible in a single sentence to do justice to this
achievement and we must take it more at large.</p>
<p>The dictator Sylla brought the works of the great Greek philosopher,
together with his library, to Rome, in the year <span class="small">B.C.</span>
147. This was on the capture of Athens, and these writings were
still comparatively unknown in Greece. The philosophy of the
Peripatetic school was, of course, familiar to their countrymen; but
it was by and through the Latin race and not the Greek, that the
&ldquo;Master of Syllogisms&rdquo; was to become most potent. Aristotle&rsquo;s
was the controlling system of the Middle Ages. His rules of
logic were imperative. They governed theology, and indeed
every other form of metaphysics. They restrained with an iron
grip the expanding ideas of men. It was against Aristotle, in the
person of William of Champeaux, future Bishop of Chalons and
founder of the school of St. Victor, that Peter Abelard laid his
lance in rest. Even to the days of Dean Swift these ideas bore
sway, and when that brilliant man sought his degree from Trinity
College, Dublin, he was met by the question whether he reasoned
according to Aristotle. And his reply, that he did well enough in
his own fashion, was held to be little less than atheism. Nor is
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
this the only comparison which might be aptly instituted between
Swift and Abelard.</p>
<p>So Aristotle had his authority and held his sceptre down almost
to our own time. But at the commencement his writings were
either used in the Greek language or in the Arabic. In the twelfth
century the schools of the Moors in Spain were the true centre
of philosophy. They first applied his teachings to theology, and
to these schools resorted many scholars from other parts of the
continent. But such translations as these travelling students
brought home were probably of a sort to make intricacy and
subtlety more intricate and subtle. A fog had gathered over
Europe, and the Dark Ages are indeed no myth. There were few
points of light anywhere, and among these few were the bright
spots called St. Gall and Reichenau.</p>
<p>Charles Jourdain asserts that only a part of Aristotle was known
before 1200 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, and that this was through the translation of
Boethius. (See Ueberweg: Hist. Philos., I., 367.) So that if
Hermannus Contractus translated Aristotle at so early a date, it
shows that his rendering was in advance of most, if not of nearly
all those which were used in the Western schools. He had a
brother, or uncle, Manegold, who died in Palestine. He had
another brother Werner, who afterward became a legate to
Gregory VII. (Hildebrand) in the fierce struggle between Pope
and Emperor in 1077. And he was further well placed both by
his family connections and his situation at a centre of learning, to
secure the best manuscripts and the best Arabic instruction. (See
an elaborate dissertation in Wegelin: <i>Thes. Rerum Suevicarum</i>,
II., p. 120.) It evinces decided wisdom and toil on his part to
have undertaken and completed this translation; and there is no
doubt that the humble paralytic from his bed of suffering influenced
materially the scholastic movements of the coming centuries.
Could he have seen the swarming thousands who built the abbey
of the Paraclete; could he have witnessed in vision the uprising
of such schools as St. Victor in France and Oxford in England;
could he have heard Roger Bacon confess his indebtedness to
those pages; could he have foreseen the infinite consequences
both to the preservation and the hindrance of human thought,
with what strange zeal he would have traced each painful line!</p>
<p>But he could not know it. He had removed at thirty years of
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
age to his perpetual celibacy at Reichenau&mdash;Augia the Rich, as
it is called in the Latin tongue. It is built on an island in the
western arm of the Lake of Constance. And there, with great
mountains to gaze upon and fair waters to catch for him the rosy
light of evening; with the brethren of the convent laboring cheerfully
in their fields or toiling in their cells, Hermann of V&ouml;hringen,
Hermann of Reichenau, Hermannus Contractus, Hermann der
Gebrechliche, Hermann the Cripple, spent his uneventful life.</p>
<p>Here he wrote the legends of some of the saints, and here he
prepared his valuable compendium of universal history. He calls
it a <i>Chronicon</i>, and condensed into its records the story of the
world from <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1 to the year 1054, the date of his own death. It
is very brief through the first portion of its account of &ldquo;the Six
Ages.&rdquo; Then its statements are fuller. When it reaches contemporaneous
events it becomes exceedingly important to the historical
student, for it is in the nature of a chronicle. Here also
the man&rsquo;s own personality occasionally appears. He speaks of
Reichenau as <i>Augia nostra</i> and mentions the basilica which Henry
III. (&ldquo;the Black&rdquo;) has erected to &ldquo;our patron, St. Mark the
Evangelist.&rdquo; This establishes the fact that Reichenau was his
true residence, and gives us the standpoint of the little isle in
Lake from which to look out across the dark-green and sometimes
stormy waters upon the confusions of the time. These were
the days when the Truce of God (1041 <span class="small">A.D.</span>) was necessary in
order to prevent the bloody feuds of the barons during Advent,
Lent, and from Wednesday evening of each week until the following
Monday morning. Yet amid all these conflicts Hermann the
Paralytic remained secure, guarded by religion and surrounded by
the peaceful lake. And like that lake the Rhine stream of secular
affairs flowed always through his life clear and undisturbed.</p>
<p>It is during these closing scenes that a touching entry is made
in the pages of the <i>Chronicon</i>. Under the year 1052 the crippled
hand slowly traces these words: &ldquo;At the same time, on January
9th, my mother Hiltrude, the wife of the Count Wolfrad, a
pious, meek, generous, and religious woman, and one who was as
devoted to and happy in her husband and her seven surviving
children as any person could be, closed the last day of her life in
about the sixty-first year of her age and the forty-fourth of her marriage,
and was buried at the Villa of Altshausen, in a sepulchre
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
under the chapel of St. Udalric which she had herself constructed.&rdquo;
And then follows a brief poem in which the merits and the love
of this dear mother are affectionately told.</p>
<p>Hermann, on the best of testimony, was a person of just this
amiable and beautiful spirit. He is called <i>hilarissimus</i>, as if to
show his great cheerfulness. He was always a strict vegetarian in
his diet. He hated injustice; scorned every sort of vice&mdash;and
Heaven alone knows how much there then was of nameless wickedness!&mdash;and
finally, he was thoroughly free from all envy and
malice. It is a curious testimony to his breadth of mind that one
of his biographers says of him (quoting the old adage), that he
regarded nothing human as alien to his search.</p>
<p>He preserved this calmness and sweetness of temper to the
farthest limit of his days. Not long before he died he said to his
faithful friend, Berthold of Constance, &ldquo;Do not, I say, do not
ask me about this; but rather attend to what I will tell you, for
in you I do not a little confide. I shall die doubtless in a very
short time. I shall not live. I shall not get well.&rdquo; He added
that he was so &ldquo;seized with an ineffable desire and delight toward
that intransitory world and that eternal and immortal life,&rdquo; that
all things of this passing existence seemed empty and vain and
dropped like motes (<i>flocci</i>) from him, in the breath of that
heavenly air.</p>
<p>And then he proceeded to detail a vision in which he fancied
himself reading and rereading the Hortensius of Cicero. His
mind was clear; his hopes for religion and for education were
high; but all was now over and he must depart. Therefore he
quietly and pathetically ends by saying, &ldquo;<i>Taedet quidem me vivere</i>&rdquo;&mdash;indeed
it is wearisome to me to live. And thus, on September
24th, 1054, he ceased from earth&mdash;in his forty-second year, and
having carried the story of the world down to the end of his own
career.</p>
<p>But his works follow him. I do most firmly believe him&mdash;and
not Robert the Second&mdash;to have been the author of the <i>Veni
Sancte Spiritus</i>.</p>
<p>The first person to attribute this hymn to the King of France is
Durand, (<i>Rationale Divinorum Officiorum</i>, Lib. IV.) His book
treats of ceremonial observances and is among the rarest of printed
volumes. The splendid copy upon vellum in the Astor Library
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
is not only beautiful in itself, but it is extremely valuable as the
<i>third</i> specimen of typography in existence. Only two works&mdash;one
of them the Bible and another the Psalter of Mainz&mdash;had been
previously printed from movable types. I have personally verified
the reference and its English rendering is as follows:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Notker, Abbot of St. Gall, in Germany, first composed sequences
with notes of his own in the <i>Alleluia</i>. And Nicholaus the Pope [Nicholas
II., 1059-1061] granted that they should be sung at masses. But Hermannus
Contractus, a German, inventor of the astrolabe, composed these
sequences: <i>Rex omnipotens</i> and <i>Sancti Spiritus</i> and <i>Ave Maria</i> and the
antiphons <i>Alma redemptoris mater</i> and <i>Simon Barjona</i>. Peter, Bishop of
Compostella, made the <i>Salve regina</i>. And the King of France, Robert
by name, composed the sequence, <i>Veni Sancte Spiritus</i> and the hymn
<i>Chorus novae Hierusalem</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hard to crowd into a paragraph more errors than are in this.
Notker was <i>not</i> Abbot of St. Gall. Innocent III. was very severe
upon Udalric of St. Gall, because such a spiritual and able man
had lived and died unhonored among them; a simple monk
whose labors and death received no special attention in their
religious year.</p>
<p>Nor did Hermann write the <i>Sancti Spiritus adsit</i>; for this, on
the best of testimony, was Notker&rsquo;s. It was so sung at Rome
under Innocent III.; and Ekkehard the Younger, in his history
of Notker, pointedly claims it for him.</p>
<p>It is very doubtful whether Hermann invented the astrolabe for
measuring the distances of stars. His two treatises are upon its
use, and he is evidently very familiar with it. But it was first
made serviceable in navigation by the Portuguese&mdash;if we are to
believe Evelyn (in his <i>Navigation</i>)&mdash;and the study of astronomy
was greatly cultivated by the Arabic schools in Spain and elsewhere
about this period. J. A. Fabricius indeed mentions that
the astrolabe was &ldquo;commonly employed in the days of Ptolemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Ave Maria</i> is supposed by Koch to belong to the thirteenth
century and some have ascribed it to Adam of St. Victor.
It is, perhaps, by Heribert of Eichstettin (died 1042). Hermann
wrote the <i>Ave praeclara maris stella</i>, which might have been mistaken
for this other.</p>
<p>The <i>Salve regina</i> is assigned by Durand to Peter of Compostella.
Gerbert names several possible authors, but evidently follows the
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
leadership of Durand. (<i>De Cantu, etc.</i>, II., 27.) And yet
Trithemius, with every really critical scholar, credits it to Hermann.
It is exhaustively considered by Wegelin and definitely
conceded to him. (<i>Thes. Rerum Suevicarum</i>, II., p. 120 <i>ff.</i>)</p>
<p>Robert the Second cannot claim the <i>Chorus novae Hierusalem</i>.
It is the production of Fulbert of Chartres (died 1029), and is
included without question in every complete edition of his works.</p>
<p>Thus the absolute authority of Durand is much shaken. He
was a lawyer in the thirteenth century, who studied at Bologna and
taught at Modena; a legate of Pope Martin IV.; dean of the
church at Chartres, and Bishop of Mende. The fact that he was
dean of Chartres, and yet ascribes the <i>Chorus Novae</i>, not to Fulbert
but to Hermannus, is suggestive, but not convincing.</p>
<p>So Durand was the first person to affix the name of Robert II.
to the <i>Veni Sancte</i>. Trithemius comes next in order; the Abbot
of Spanheim; historian and scholar; indefatigable in researches,
but erratic and prejudiced; born 1462 and dying 1516. His true
name is Johann von Trittenheim and we derive this, and other
information about authors and their works, from his <i>Liber de
Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis</i>&mdash;a biographical dictionary like those of
Jerome, Gennadius, and Isidore, to whose works he really furnishes
an Appendix. Egon (sometimes known as Ego) in his account of
Reichenau&rsquo;s distinguished men (<i>De Viris illustribus Augiae divitis</i>,
quoted by Pez: <i>Thesaurus Anecdotorum</i>, I., 3; 68. Cf. Migne,
143) declares that Trithemius was &ldquo;unjustly hostile to the monks
of Reichenau&rdquo; in asserting that &ldquo;our Hermannus&rdquo; was from St.
Gall, when even Metzler conceded, on behalf of his own convent,
that Hermann had changed his residence from St. Gall to
Reichenau. Be this as it may, the positive statement of Trithemius,
which gives the <i>Veni Sancte</i> to Robert II. instead of to Hermann,
has been generally accepted. Cardinal Bona (1677),
Louis Archon (1704-11), and others agree with him.</p>
<p>But there is a break in the continuity of faith. Clichtove&mdash;an
authority much esteemed&mdash;expresses no opinion about the
author of the <i>Veni Sancte</i> further than to say
<i>quisquis is fuerit</i>&mdash;whoever he was.</p>
<p>Rambach, in his <i>Anthology</i>, comes now to the rescue. (<i>Anthologie</i>,
I., 227.) He says it is &ldquo;<i>ganz unstreitig von Robert;</i>&rdquo; and
all the German critics, with the single exception of Daniel, have followed
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
this authority blindly. Whatever the Germans said has
usually been enough for the English. Therefore the <i>Veni Sancte</i>
is in every collection attributed, without a shadow of doubt, to
Robert the King.</p>
<p>There should have been less positiveness about this if the accurate
Daniel had been noticed more carefully. He praises the language
of Clichtove, who says that the author, &ldquo;whoever he
was,&rdquo; must have been &ldquo;inwardly filled with light,&rdquo; and he italicizes
the <i>quisquis is fuerit</i>. But as Robert, with only three others,
appears to have escaped the wreck of the sequences in the sixteenth
century, even Daniel allows the <i>Veni Sancte</i> to him; and
Archbishop Trench finds that &ldquo;there exists no good reason why
we should question&rdquo; that Robert wrote it.</p>
<p>We may dismiss any conjectures about Innocent III. having
been its author, although great efforts have been made to credit
this hymn to his pen. Dom Remy Cellier and Migne seem the
most strongly partisan, but their remarks and references are weak.
(<i>Scriptores Ecclesiastici</i>, vol. xiii., p. 109, note. Also <i>Patrologia</i>,
141; 901.)</p>
<p>A sample of the general looseness of citation can be found in
Kehrein (No. 125), who announces that Gerbert &ldquo;holds Hermannus
Contractus to be the author&rdquo; of the <i>Veni Sancte</i>. Gerbert
does nothing of the kind. He names Hermann <i>with others</i>. It
is quite true, though, that he does <i>not</i> name Robert.</p>
<p>Setting aside Innocent III. for cause&mdash;although Brander of
St. Gall, in his <i>Index Sequentiarum</i>, grants this to him&mdash;the authorship
of the hymn rests between the king and the monk. I say
&ldquo;for cause,&rdquo; since Innocent was at the summit of temporal power,
and his position was a very tempting one to posthumous flattery.
He is credited with the <i>Ave mundi spes Mariae</i>. He did not write
the <i>Stabat Mater</i>, nor did he compose the <i>Veni Sancte</i>. Let any
one examine the <i>Ave mundi</i> and he will renounce all hope that the
man who prepared this could ever have written the others, or
either of them. Besides, Wrangham is likely to be correct when
he assigns this latter sequence to Adam of St. Victor. It is precisely
in Adam&rsquo;s style of metrical composition; it is not found
before the fourteenth century, and its tone is modern. It can
therefore be said that Innocent deserves no place among the Latin
hymn-writers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Now, Robert II. is much in the same condition as Innocent III.
His is a shining name to which to affix popular hymns. He has
been credited with the <i>Ave maris stella</i>&mdash;the parent of all hymns
to the Virgin. The sequence <i>Sancti Spiritus adsit</i> is not his, on
the testimony already adduced; but in the year 1110 the &ldquo;ancient
customs of Cluny,&rdquo; collected by St. Udalric (Hermann&rsquo;s ancestor)
gives us this &ldquo;at Pentecost&rdquo; (D&rsquo;Achery: <i>Spicilegium</i>, I., 641),
with the &ldquo;response,&rdquo; <i>Spiritus sanctus</i>. This would serve to show
that such praise to the Holy Spirit was usual. With the <i>Chorus
Novae</i> we have already dealt. And the <i>Rex omnipotens</i> belongs to
Hermann though it is ascribed to Robert&mdash;another instance of
inaccuracy, which casts a ray of light upon the present problem.</p>
<p>Those sequences of which Robert was the possible author are
printed in Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia</i> (141, 959 <i>ff.</i>). Only one of them
merits a word of notice. It is the <i>Te lucis auctor personent</i>.
Daniel assigns this to the fourteenth or fifteenth century, but
Mone and Koch to the fifth. These last are probably right. It
is early found in the Anglo-Saxon Church and is among the old
Vatican <span class="small">MSS.</span> and the hymns collected by G. Cassander. It is
scarcely possible that it comes down as late as the eleventh century.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s other sequences are six in number and of no importance.
His personal history is pathetic enough. He was the son
of Hugh Capet; born at Orleans in 970 and died at Melun, July
20th, 1031, having been sole king since 996, though he had been
crowned in 988. His first wife was Susanne, an Italian princess;
and we learn from his contemporary, Richer of Rheims, that one
of his first public acts was to repudiate her on the plea that she
was too old for him, and that he refused to restore her dowry.
His next marriage was with his distant cousin Bertha&mdash;a cousin
four times removed&mdash;the widow of the Count of Blois. This
marriage was inconvenient to the Emperor Otho, as it would have
brought the House of Capet into the line of succession to certain
lordships in the old Kingdom of Burgundy. So Pope Gregory
V., the kinsman of Otho, required Robert to give up Bertha, not
because Susanne was still alive, but because the Church forbade
the marriage of cousins in even the fourth degree. At first Robert
refused, but when his kingdom was laid under an interdict, he
showed as little manhood in standing by his second wife as he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
shown humanity and justice to his first. Such a ban was too
severe to be borne and the king yielded, though Baronius says he
tried to take back his wife Bertha in spite of it all. His life and
kingship belong to French history, and can be found there. His
disposition was that of a monk and not of a monarch. He
founded four monasteries and built seven churches. He supported
three hundred paupers entirely and a thousand in part.
His reign lasted&mdash;thanks to ecclesiastical influence&mdash;for thirty-four
years. It was troubled and not especially pleasant; and for his
third wife the king had married the handsome shrew Constance,
the daughter of William Count of Arles. Pious and excellent
man that he is reputed to have been, he had a natural son,
Amauri, who was great-great-grandfather to Simon de Montfort.
Truly, when all is said and done, Robert II. is hardly the author
in whom we would like to believe with all our hearts when we
sing&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Holy Spirit, come and shine</p>
<p class="t0">Sweetly in this heart of mine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><i>Per contra</i>, Hermann of Reichenau grows more interesting the
more he is studied. He has been so unfortunate as to be confused
with other persons in two or three cases. By Brander he is
identified with Hartmann of St. Gall, and the sequence <i>Rex omnipotens</i> is taken
from him.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> The pretty little sequence, <i>Veni
Sancte Spiritus et reple</i>, which K&ouml;nigsfeld thinks to be his, is
doubtless no earlier than the fourteenth century and by some
anonymous composer who has merely imitated the great masters.</p>
<p>Beside the <i>Rex omnipotens</i> he composed the <i>Ave praeclara maris
stella</i>, where his name gains another misprint and becomes &ldquo;Heinricus,
monachus San Gallensis.&rdquo; This poem was thought worthy
of the authorship of Albertus Magnus (Albert von Regensburg),
and to him accordingly Wackernagel and Koch credit it. Mone
has vindicated the claim of Hermann which is set forth in Migne.
(<i>Patrologia</i>, 143; 20 <i>ff.</i>) So that we are again sure of a piece
which has been meritorious enough to be coveted.</p>
<p>Then comes the antiphon <i>Simon Barjona</i>, which Du Meril calls
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
<i>Simon Baronia</i> and of which no trace remains. Two other
sequences are, however, extant, and are beyond any question or
debate. They are the <i>Salve regina</i>, which Daniel calls a &ldquo;most
celebrated antiphon,&rdquo; and the <i>Alma redemptoris mater</i>, the refrain
of which Chaucer used in that &ldquo;Prioress&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; which Wordsworth
has modernized.</p>
<p>In addition we must observe that the <i>Veni Sancte</i> is attributed
to Hermann simultaneously and by the same authority as that
which credits him with the other sequences. Two pieces&mdash;<i>Vox
haec melos pangat</i> and <i>Gratus honos hierarchia</i>&mdash;are lost. But the
<i>Salve regina</i> was worth contending for; and Gerbert names Gregory
II., Peter of Compostella, St. Bernard, and &ldquo;Adhemar, Episcopus
Podiensis&rdquo; (Bishop of Puy and his own candidate) together with
Hermannus Contractus. Nevertheless, Trithemius, Gerbert, and,
indeed, everybody are heard to declare that Hermann was &ldquo;the
marvel of the age,&rdquo; the best man of his time in music and the
author of a work on metrical rules. He is known as Doctor
Egregius, and it is beyond any peradventure that he was <i>capable</i>
of writing the <i>Veni Sancte</i>.</p>
<p>The only arguments that are employed to prove that Robert
was the author are very weak. The <i>first</i> is that there was no
sufficient competitor. But surely Hermannus Contractus is now
a competitor of real merit and importance. Then, too, the king
was a kind of religious pet, and such persons receive more than
their due. But the <i>second</i> argument is weaker still. It amounts
in brief to the harmony displayed in the poem between the king&rsquo;s
life and his lovely verses. It strikes one, however, that an invalid
like Hermann might have had fully as deep a religious experience
as any such king. Moreover&mdash;and this is a vital fact&mdash;the <i>Veni
Sancte</i> is found in the <i>German</i> hymnaries almost exclusively.
This point was insisted upon in the controversy about the <i>Veni,
Creator</i>; and Charles the Great in this respect had the advantage over
Gregory the Great, until the claim of Rabanus Maurus, another
German, was thoroughly examined. But among all the sources
carefully edited by Kehrein from Daniel, Mone, and elsewhere,
the French collections do not present themselves. On the contrary,
in this elaborate list we find St. Gall, Kreuzlingen, Freiburg,
Karlsruhe, Mainz, Ebersberg, Rome (1481), Venice (1497), with
later examples printed at Cologne, Prague, Eichstettin, Lubeck,
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
and Basel. Brander also found the hymn in the earliest codices
of the three great neighboring cloisters of St. Gall, Einsiedeln, and
Reichenau. Meanwhile the only notice of it in France comes
from the Paris Breviary, which is of recent date.</p>
<p>There is but one consideration further. I trust that I have
established the perfect possibility that Hermannus Contractus
might have been the author equally as well as Robert. The men
lived in the same period to which, on the testimony of the best
critics, the hymn is considered to belong. They were alike in
possibilities of Christian experience and of musical and poetical
temperament. But here they begin to diverge; and the preference
is decidedly in favor of Hermann, whose hymn is found in
the three oldest codices of his own neighborhood; of St. Gall,
where he studied; of Einsiedeln, where it is possible that he was a
resident; and of Reichenau, where he certainly lived from the age
of thirty until his death. He could scarcely have gone about very
much in his helpless and crippled condition; and these three
conventual establishments are within a moderate distance of each
other. From his seventh year he was to be discovered always
somewhere in that vicinity, and the historians of St. Gall and of
Reichenau positively claim the <i>Veni Sancte</i> as his.</p>
<p>It is only left for us to lay the <i>Salve regina</i> side by side with the
<i>Veni Sancte</i>. A man who wrote upon metre ought to possess
some excellence in the art of which he wrote, and these pieces
placed together display a graceful and ingenious versification which
is not at all usual in that century. It is not claimed that either
Robert or Hermann wrote other hymns in the identical stanza
form of the <i>Veni Sancte</i>. Therefore nothing is available for direct
comparison. But as to the spirit of each there can be no debate.
Robert never composed anything else like the <i>Veni Sancte</i>,
and it certainly seems as if Hermann did compose a sequence
which bears a passing resemblance; and which I have endeavored
to translate with its occasional rhymes and assonances:</p>

</div>
<p>This very singular construction of clauses is apparent to the eye
at once. Let it be remembered that Robert uses it nowhere else,
and that the most of Hermann&rsquo;s writings are gone. This chance
for the &ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; is therefore taken from us. If it could
be shown, however, that this was a method employed by the monk
of Reichenau in his prose works, the case might be regarded as
absolutely proven, in so far as it demonstrates that the bulk of the
presumptive evidence is in his favor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>But here we are at fault. We can only add probability to probability
and leave all absolute demonstration alone. Pez has preserved
not merely Egon&rsquo;s account of Hermann&rsquo;s life, but he has
edited Hermann&rsquo;s treatises on the astrolabe (<i>Thes. Anecdot. Tom.</i>,
III., pt. 2, p. 94) from a <span class="small">MS.</span> codex in the monastery of St. Peter
at Salzburg. His musical treatise is reprinted by Gerbert.
(<i>Scriptores Eccl. de Musica</i>, vol. ii., p. 124.) The didactic poem
reciting the combat of the Sheep and the Flax&mdash;always recognized
as the production of Hermann&mdash;is in Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia</i> and also
in Du Meril&rsquo;s <i>Poesies Populaires</i>. Unfortunately none of these
writings are of a sort to help us. We cannot by their assistance
make any headway in critical analysis.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that J. A. Fabricius in his great work on the
Middle Age and later Latin writers, allows Hermann to be the
author of the <i>Veni Sancte</i>, following the testimony of Egon and
Metzler. And it is more than noticeable that Du Meril&mdash;himself
a Frenchman&mdash;should also apparently concede the hymn to this
German.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>I have made an exhaustive search for everything bearing upon
the life and writings of Hermannus Contractus. I have pursued
him and Robert through the <i>Quellen</i> of German history; through
the writings and compilations of Canisius and Despont and Urstitius
and Martene and Mabillon and D&rsquo;Achery and Pertz and the
<i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica</i> of the &ldquo;Society for Opening the
Sources of German History.&rdquo; In these and in the encyclopaedias
of La Rousse and Ersch-Gruber and the great <i>Patrologia</i> of Migne,
I have investigated every by-path and blind alley. It is abundantly
clear that he was the most distinguished man of his region,
and, likely, of his period. Usserman and Possevin have devoted
attention to him. (<i>Prodromus Germ. Sacr. Tom.</i> I., p. 145 <i>sqq.</i>,
<i>De Apparatu</i>.) His didactic poem on the &ldquo;Eight Principal Vices&rdquo;
is in Haupt&rsquo;s <i>Zeitschrift</i>, vol. xiii. His lives of Conrad and
of Henry III. have not been preserved. That he was a very
voluminous writer is also evident. After giving the names of some
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
of his sequences Metzler adds that there were <i>cetera mille alia</i>&mdash;a
thousand more. So also speaks Trithemius; and indeed this
testimony is universal.</p>
<p>A single line of inquiry has been left to the American student.
We have lists of the <span class="small">MSS.</span> in the various libraries of Europe. If it
were only possible to examine these with reference to the <i>Veni
Sancte</i> the matter could be definitely settled. The Rheinau
(Reichenau) library is rich in hymnaries. Haenel&rsquo;s &ldquo;No. 53&rdquo;&mdash;whose
library number is 91&mdash;is, for instance, a <i>Liber hymnorum</i> of
the tenth to the twelfth centuries. There are several others&mdash;breviaries
and collections of hymns&mdash;dating to the twelfth century; and
one book, &ldquo;No. 124&rdquo; (Lib. No. 75), which is marked <i>Sequentiae
propriae</i>, etc., and which is likely to have the <i>Veni Sancte</i>. In
the eleventh century at St. Gall they have &ldquo;No. 381&rdquo; (St. Gall
No. 486) which is a <i>codex insignis</i>&mdash;a very beautiful <span class="small">MS.</span>&mdash;containing
the &ldquo;earliest collection of hymns and poems of writers dwelling
at St. Gall.&rdquo; In this same century appears the Anselm, which
is noted as a <i>codex nobiliter scriptus ab Herimanno, qui se hoc libri
decus ex voto perfecisse testatur</i> (<i>pag.</i> 6), a manuscript elegantly
written by Hermann [&ldquo;Herimann&rdquo; is his own spelling of his
name in the <i>Chronicon</i>, by the way], who says on page 6 that he
has accomplished this excellent volume in pursuance of a vow.
Among these St. Gall <span class="small">MSS.</span> can be found the <i>Salve regina</i>, bearing
the date 1437. If it were made a point of investigation it might
be discovered that in both Reichenau and St. Gall the <i>Veni, Sancte
Spiritus</i> is in codices which utterly remove it from the perplexity
of its authorship, and positively join it to the name of Hermann.</p>
<p>One can sum up the whole discussion in a few sentences. Robert
wrote no other valuable hymns; Hermann did write several.
Robert was not specially skilled in metrical science; Hermann
was the author of a treatise on the subject. Robert was a poet
and a musician; Hermann was his superior in both departments.
Robert had trouble and sorrow and Christian experience; Hermann
must certainly have had as much as he, and more. Robert
has had poems attributed to him which have failed of proof, and
none of his own verses seem ever to have been misappropriated or
missing; Hermann has had more taken from him than given to
him.</p>
<p>In the matter of authority we are to note:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>1. That the historians of St. Gall and of Reichenau claim for
Hermann the <i>Veni Sancte</i>.</p>
<p>2. That the hymn is found in the earliest codices of both places;
and of Einsiedeln, which is in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>3. That Clichtove is in doubt and Daniel is in doubt; that
J. A. Fabricius and Du Meril incline toward Egon&rsquo;s
statement; that Trithemius is not entirely unprejudiced; and that
Migne, gathering nearly everything (as I have verified from the
originals), leaves a strong presumption in Hermann&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>I may appear to make a good deal too much of this matter of
mediaeval jealousy. But no student of those times needs to be
told that the jealousy between the various cloisters was excessive.
There is a letter of the Reichenau monk Gunzo, written in 960.
(<i>Martene</i>, I., 296.) It is addressed to the &ldquo;holy congregation
at Reichenau&rdquo; and describes his journey to St. Gall. The distance
was great enough to exhaust the learned brother; he was
lifted off of his beast and carried in by hospitable hands. Notwithstanding
which he vents his indignation upon their methods
and their lack of scholarship. They are self indulgent; they are
a fraud on the face of the earth. <i>Nihil inde sed fraudis molamina
parabantur</i>&mdash;they do nothing there except contrive a great mass
of deception, says the angry Gunzo. They attacked him on his
grammar; and he attacked them in turn on their loquacity. The
epistle is grimly humorous at this distance of time; but the bitterness
was altogether too genuine to be pleasant.</p>
<p>Far away from the most of these noises&mdash;separated by the
waters of the lake from the trampling pilgrim-bands who went to
and fro between the East and West&mdash;Hermann of Reichenau
passed his quiet hours. His convent was rich. Its abbot was
said to be able to journey to Rome and not sleep anywhere on the
way except upon his own soil. It had been founded in 724 under
the auspices of Charles Martel. Such was the admirable situation
of this religious house&mdash;sufficient to itself in the midst of all
changes.</p>
<p>They buried Hermann in his ancestral tomb at Altshausen. In
1631 &ldquo;three bones&rdquo; of him were exhumed and carried &ldquo;by force&rdquo;
to the monastery of Ochsenhausen, but who took them and who
resisted the taking of them, we are not told. These are the
meagre particulars of a life gentle, patient, and unassuming&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
life of a scholar and of a poet&mdash;who mastered great obstacles by
the genius of faith.</p>
<p>Three hundred years before Christ there came into Ceylon the
Buddhist missionary Mahinda. The king received him kindly
and built for him and his monks a convent on the hill Mihintale,
to the east of the royal city. On the western face of this hill
Mahinda had his own retreat cut out from the living rock. Still
can be seen&mdash;though after two thousand years&mdash;this study in
which the great teacher of Ceylon &ldquo;sat and thought and worked
through the long years of his peaceful and useful life.&rdquo; Under the
cool shadow of his rock, with his stone couch on which to repose,
and with the busy plain, so far removed from him, sending
its faint noises up from below, there wrought the sage. And
there he died at last and was buried in the neighboring Dag&#257;ba.
Modern times have nearly forgotten him, but no story of that
valley or that island is complete without his name.</p>
<p>And so, in this later manner, lived and died Hermann Count
of V&ouml;hringen, who laid down earthly honors to take up the pursuit
of heavenly glory; who overcame peevishness of mind and
weakness of body by faith and hope and love; who looked out
upon his times from this serene distance, and who went to his last
sleep beneath the shadow of the rock.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;I am not ignorant that Jourdain (<i>Recherches critiques
sur l&rsquo;Age et l&rsquo;Origine des Traductions latines d&rsquo;Aristote</i>. Paris,
1819 and 1843) has attacked the ascription of translations of
Aristotle from the Arabic to our Hermann, denying that the
cripple of Reichenau possessed any knowledge of that tongue.
Briefly stated his arguments are these: 1. That Trithemius
followed Jacobus of Bergamo in ascribing to H. Contractus a
knowledge of Arabic. 2. That Metzler (whom he calls <i>Mezler</i>)
has added the statement about the Poetics and Rhetoric. 3. That
every one else has followed these two authorities. 4. That &ldquo;H.
Alemannus&rdquo; wrote in <i>Toledo</i>, to which the other Hermann could
not have journeyed. 5. That the translations were by this &ldquo;H.
Alemannus&rdquo; (Hermann the German) who flourished in the first
half of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>It is enough of a reply to say: 1. That the concluding words
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
of a manuscript relate, not to its author, but to its transcriber.
The <span class="small">MS.</span> mentioned by Jourdain and the other <span class="small">MS.</span> in the Bibliotheque
Royale of the fifteenth century (viz., <i>Doctrina Matumeti,
quae apud Saracenos magnae auctoritatis est, ab Hermanno latine
translata.</i> Cod. <span class="small">MS.</span>, No. 6225) are both later than their original
date. This second <span class="small">MS.</span> may be by Hermann de Schildis, a monk
of the thirteenth century. 2. Every one has not &ldquo;followed&rdquo; the
authority of Metzler and Trithemius. The &ldquo;Anonymus Mellicensis&rdquo;
(twelfth century) enumerates treatises by Hermannus Contractus
upon Computation, Astronomy, Physiognomy and Poetry,
which at least imply that Aristotle had largely affected his studies.
3. It is notable also to find H. <i>Alemannus</i> quoting Cicero in his
two introductions, when we know H. <i>Contractus</i> to have been
very fond of Cicero. 4. H. Alemannus says that he has met
great &ldquo;impediments&rdquo; and &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; in accomplishing this
translation, and that the difference between Latin and Arabic
poetry forbade a poetical rendering. Which would coincide with
H. Contractus&rsquo;s personal obstacles and with his natural desire as a
poet to attempt a rendering in verse. 5. H. Alemannus refers
to &ldquo;Johannes Burgensis&rdquo; (John of Burgau, in Suabia) as a bishop
and the king&rsquo;s chancellor and his personal friend and the promoter
of this work. I cannot find &ldquo;John of Burgau;&rdquo; but H. Contractus
was a Suabian, and Suabia is very near to Reichenau.
H. Contractus was also closely associated with Conrad and Henry
III., whose lives he wrote.</p>
<p>It is a curious question this. It is only another proof of the
neglect into which a great man has fallen. For Hermann is
called &ldquo;nostri <i>miraculum</i> seculi&rdquo; by the next generation who came
after him. And there is no <i>absolute</i> proof that, &ldquo;without lexicon
or grammar&rdquo; (for so Jourdain puts it), he could not have mastered
Arabic. Observing the topics of his other writings cognate to
those of Aristotle, I am therefore not in the least inclined to yield
to even M. Charles Jourdain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">PETER DAMIANI, CARDINAL AND FLAGELLANT.</span></h2>
<p>It is not every poet who begins by keeping the swine and ends
by wearing the red hat and purple robe of a cardinal-bishop. Nor
is it every poet who commences as a forlorn and deserted foundling,
to whom it is a great mercy to have even swine to keep by
way of getting his daily bread. But all this and more befell
Damiani.</p>
<p>We are not informed about his parentage, except that he had a
mother who abandoned him, and a brother (or, more probably,
an uncle) who took pity on him. He was born in Ravenna.
Some authorities say it was in 988; others that it was in 1007.
A modern hymnologist, anxious to be right (though he is frequently
wrong), sets it at 1002. But 1007 has the greatest weight
of evidence.</p>
<p>This brother, or uncle, had compassion on the lad, and poor
little outcast Peter was sent by him &ldquo;into his fields to feed swine,&rdquo;
a much more honorable employment of course in Italy than in
Palestine, and one which he shared with Nicholas Brakespeare,
the English pope, Hadrian IV. What was his previous history
we cannot discover, though the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> for February 23d
is full of legendary accounts. We only know that his natural
abilities attracted the notice of another relative (brother, some say),
who was an archdeacon at Ravenna. He it was who advanced
Peter to the opportunities of education, and who proved so fast a
friend that the boy took his patron&rsquo;s name for his own. As
Eusebius called himself Eusebius Pamphili (Pamphilus&rsquo;s Eusebius),
so Peter became Peter Damiani, &ldquo;Damian&rsquo;s Peter,&rdquo; and
this designation has adhered to him ever since. It is amusing to
read now and then of <i>Peter Damianus</i>, as if Damiani were an
Italian nominative case instead of a Latin genitive.</p>
<p>His birth was too obscure to lead any person to interfere with
him. He therefore quietly studied and improved, to the edification
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
of his fellow-pupils and the admiration of his teachers. His
school-training was, first of all, in Faenza. Thence he was sent
to Parma, and eventually he returned to Ravenna, where he taught
with distinction and popular approval, until he was nearly or
quite thirty years old.</p>
<p>The age was barbarous and good professors were scarce. It
seems to have been expected that brilliant minds would go on
shining like those exhaustless lamps which are fabled to have been
found in the tombs of the old magicians. If such was the case,
with the intense intellect of Damiani he must have tapped some
source of real spiritual power early in his course, for he burns
brightly even now as we read his vivid truthfulness and peruse
some of his lovely verses, out from which leap, nevertheless,
tongues of flaming scorn for hypocrites and simonists.</p>
<p>Yes, the age was barbarous, and therefore Peter Damiani was
soon a professor, with many students and an abundance of fees.
Knowledge in those days not only meant power but wealth, and
he was fast growing rich in Ravenna. It was a delightful life, but
it did not suit him. He was, in fact, the &ldquo;spiritual kinsman,
and in many respects the pioneer&rdquo; of Gregory VII. Hildebrand
came to be, after awhile, his personal friend, his <i>sanctus Sathanas</i>,
his Mephistopheles, his instigator and stimulant. Of a sudden,
then, he departed from Ravenna to take up his abode with the
hermits of Fonte Avellana, near Gubbio. Here he was known by
the name of Frater Honestus, and surely he deserved the title, for
he was a swift witness against every sort of sin. Guy, the abbot,
persuaded him to undertake the instruction of the brethren, and
thus he found himself back at his old work of teaching once more.</p>
<p>It was not long before the new monk became prior of the convent.
Then, in 1041, he rose to be abbot. And then, in 1047,
he indited to Pope Leo IX. his famous <i>Liber Gomorrhianus</i>. This
<i>Gomorrah Book</i> is just what its name implies. It is one of the
earliest protests uttered within the Church against the awful
wickedness which was everywhere prevalent.</p>
<p>The subject is far too unpleasant for me to deal with it at any
length. And yet this disagreeable topic forces itself upon the
notice of the student of that period wherever he may turn. Most
ingenious and sophistical distinctions were made in those days
relative to sin. This thing, for instance, was wrong; but that
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
other was not half so wrong as this was. Such an offence was to
be condoned by a trifling penance, and such another was to be
only met by years of contrition. Against all this hypocritical
nastiness Damiani set his pen. No more scathing book was ever
written. And the only wonder is that it has evaded the vigilance
of the men who suffered by it, and has made its escape into type,
never again to be in peril of its existence. Bayle&mdash;who may be
safely accounted unapproachable in such abstruse inquiries&mdash;has
given us the whole story of this book. It was a terrible scourge
to the vices of the clergy, and even Baronius allows that it was not
written one moment too soon.</p>
<p>The pope to whom this remarkable document was addressed
was a man of appropriate spirit. He was the third in the series
of five able German popes, who labored so hard in the cause of
disciplinary reform. At Hildebrand&rsquo;s advice, he had laid aside the
papal insignia, which he donned at his election, and came to
Rome as a barefooted pilgrim in 1048. He aimed to put down
simony, to stop the barter and sale of benefices, and to secure the
celibacy of the clergy. To this end he used the synods with vigor,
and was ready for almost any proposed reform which fell in with
his line of operations. He was of the German, not the ultramontane
party, and therefore was quite liberal in his construction of the
great text, &ldquo;Thou art Peter,&rdquo; and went so far as to say that the
Church should first of all be built upon the true rock, which was
Christ. To him, then, the <i>Gomorrah Book</i> went, and it made a stir.</p>
<p>The next four popes occupied among them no longer period of
ecclesiastical rule than from the year 1054 to the year 1061. Matters
were unsettled. No one continued in office. But the finger
of Hildebrand the cardinal was mightier than the hand of any
pope. Nicholas II. was guided by him, and Alexander II., who
came forward in 1061, was unquestionably under his control.
And when Alexander appeared, it seemed that the <i>Gomorrah Book</i>
was still an element of unrest and disturbance, at a time when the
claims of an Antipope (Honorius II.) had been set up by the
Imperialist party, and it was necessary for even Hildebrand&rsquo;s
friends to give as little offence as possible to the clergy. For the
election of Alexander was clearly irregular, because it was in
defiance of the rules laid down by Nicholas II. at a Lateran
Synod in 1059. With a genial and suave manner the new pontiff
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
now borrowed the work for the ostensible purpose of having it
copied by the help of the Abbot of St. Saviour. That was the
last that Damiani saw of it for some little while.</p>
<p>If Alexander thought that the hermit abbot of Fonte Avellana
would submit to this method of suppression he flattered his soul
in vain. Damiani, after a reasonable delay, appealed to his friend
Hildebrand. The book was like a part of himself, and he had no
desire to have it treated with neglect. One cannot here follow the
windings of the story further than to say that Damiani got his
book again, and now we have it too.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the blindness which prevents some writers
from seeing in this Peter de Honestis a most noble and consistent
character. Morheim only pays him a merited compliment when
he says that his &ldquo;genius, candor, integrity, and writings of various
kinds, entitle him to rank among the first men of the age, although
he was not free from the faults of the times.&rdquo; But how could
one easily avoid the extreme of severity who was confronted by
the grossest sins that ever carried a hissing sibilant in front of their
names! Flagellation was a natural reaction from those fleshly
lusts that warred against the soul.</p>
<p>Somehow Hildebrand took a great fancy to this genuine reformer.
His own great schemes were ripening, and Damiani was
just the man to be made of value in the office of cardinal. In
1057, then, the abbot had been created cardinal-bishop of Ostia
by Pope Nicholas II., and in the year following deacon of the
holy college. At first he strenuously resisted the honor, but was
forced to assume it by the Pope&rsquo;s command. In 1059 he had
acted as papal legate to the semi-independent Ambrosian Church
of Milan. Here he obtained pledges from them that they would
conduct their affairs with purity and agree to receive the authority
of the Roman pontiff.</p>
<p>He did not remain among the cardinals very long. His convent
allured him, and the display requisite to his proper duties was
both irksome and repugnant to him. Therefore he went home
again, ardently devoted to Hildebrand, but devoid of all ambition,
and ready to denounce the Pope or anybody else when it appeared
that the rights of the Church were infringed.</p>
<p>In 1062 Alexander II. found use for him as legate to France,
and he influenced Cluny in favor of Alexander II. In 1068-69 we
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
find him again a legate in Germany, impressing on young Henry
IV. the importance of submission to Rome. This, too, he
effected; and in 1072&mdash;the last year of his life&mdash;he appears in
the same capacity at the age of sixty six, busy with the reform of
the Church in his native Ravenna.</p>
<p>This is the outline of his story, and it bears no great marks of
difference from others which have been commemorated in ecclesiastical
history. Upon these services, and upon his relations to
Hildebrand, a claim to considerable repute might be established
for him. These facts, however, would not keep him in mind to-day
so well as his doctrine of flagellation and the melody of his
two grand hymns.</p>
<p>This matter of flagellation was older than Damiani&rsquo;s time. It
was permitted in the convents to give five &ldquo;disciplinary strokes.&rdquo;
Starting at this point Peter the Honest asks, &ldquo;Why may we not
give the sixth, for the same reason?&rdquo; If these five have been
inflicted on the unwilling victim, why should he not secure some
credit to himself by taking a sixth, a seventh, an eighth? The ice
once broken, it is easy to see how the new custom would be seized
upon by the ascetic hermits of Fonte Avellana. The argument is
curious, as a specimen of that specious reasoning to which the
ecclesiastic mind was tending, and which, later on, comes into full
bloom among the Jesuit fathers.</p>
<p>Damiani inquires &ldquo;if our Saviour was not beaten; if Paul did
not receive, on several occasions, forty stripes save one; if all
the apostles were not scourged; and whether the martyrs had not
received the same punishment. Did not St. Jerome say that these
were scourged by order of God? And who dares deny that they
were scourged for others and not for themselves? Hence, if one
undertakes this discipline, willingly, for himself, he must be doing
a good thing.&rdquo; (See Fleury: <i>Hist. Ecclesiastique</i>, XII., p. 107,
<i>Anno</i> 1062.) He then adds the example of Guy, his predecessor,
who died 1046, and of Poppo, a contemporary, who had died in
1048. The date of his own advocacy of this doctrine is about
1056.</p>
<p>Monte Cassino took up the practice with vigor; but in Peter&rsquo;s
own convent the most consummate example of flagellation was
speedily developed, and his disciple, Dominic of the Cuirass
(<i>Dominicus Loricatus</i>), carries off the palm from all posterity. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
method proposed by Damiani was that the psalter should be recited
to the accompaniment of the blows of the scourge. Every psalm
called for one hundred strokes; the whole psalter for fifteen
thousand. By this spiritual arithmetic three thousand equalled
one year of purgatory, and therefore the complete psalter answered
for five years of purgation removed from either one&rsquo;s self or one&rsquo;s
neighbor. But Dominic was an inebriate in his flogging and set
himself tasks of stupendous size. He also improved the art in
several respects. He used both hands with dreadful facility, and
frequently lashed his face until it was covered with blood, singing
his psalms the while in a harsh, cracked, and terrible voice.
In the forty days of one Lent he recited the psalter two hundred
times, and inflicted what one reckless calculator calls &ldquo;sixty million
stripes&rdquo; upon himself. The true number is three million,
which is clearly sufficient.</p>
<p>At another occasion he literally flogged himself &ldquo;against time,&rdquo;
apparently just to see what could be done by a determined man in
twenty-four hours. At the end of that period he had gone through
the psalter twelve times and a fraction over, and had given himself
one hundred and eighty-three thousand stripes, working away with
both hands (as a caustic writer suggests) &ldquo;in the interest of the
great sinking fund of the Catholic Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flagellation, like the dancing mania and the strange parades of
the Turlepins and Anabaptists in the Middle Ages, has its root in
nervous excitement and morbid devotion. Under Anthony of
Padua, about 1210, all Perugia lashed themselves through the
streets. Justin of Padua relates that great disorders and indecency
attended the processions. The madness spread like wildfire
through Rome and Italy. In 1260 and in 1261 the custom
was again revived after some decadence, in the same town of
Perugia and under one Rainer. And at this date thousands went
out into Germany led by priests with banners and crosses. Again
fading from public notice, the flagellants reappeared during the
progress of the plague in 1349. Hecker and Cooper supplement
the account given by Boileau. The affair was itself an epidemic.
The company marched and sang hymns&mdash;among which was the
<i>Stabat Mater</i>&mdash;and bore tapers and magnificent banners. They
finally became a regular nomadic tribe, separating into two portions,
one of which went to the south and the other to the north.
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
The Church was powerless, and those <i>pro</i> and <i>anti</i> flagellationists,
who happened to be in ecclesiastical authority, solemnly excommunicated each other!</p>
<p>The wild license of these scenes was far from aiding either
morality or religion. Clement VI. (1332-52) issued his bull
against them. And, inasmuch as these fanatics had failed to restore
a dead child to life in Strasburg, the malediction of Rome
had some effect, and once more the harsh custom died out.</p>
<p>Then there was another upheaval under Venturinus, a Dominican
of Bergamo, and ten thousand persons joined the order. Like
a perennial plant it again perished and again sprang up in 1414,
when these awful orgies were renewed under the leadership of a
person named Conrad. But now the Inquisition interfered, and
among the testimony taken to show the lengths to which the fanaticism
went is the sworn evidence of a citizen of Nordhausen who,
in 1446, asserted that his wife wanted to have the children scourged
just as soon as they had been baptized!</p>
<p>Once more, in the sixteenth century the Black and Gray Penitents
appeared in France. In 1574 the Queen-mother put herself
at the head of the black band in Avignon, and the disorders, indecency,
and general depravity of manners which followed would
scarcely be believed even if it was proper to mention them.</p>
<p>From that date to the present time more or less of this old insanity
occasionally reappears. It affords a singular commentary
on our boasted advance beyond those dark ages, for us to know
that the <i>Penitentes</i> of our own Californian coast do precisely every
year what Dominic of the Cuirass and Anthony of Padua and
Conrad and Rainer all did centuries ago.</p>
<p>And this frightful enginery of fanaticism was set in motion by
the man who wrote one of the loveliest hymns in the Latin language!</p>
<p>I make no attempt to analyze the feelings that have prompted
this strange austerity. Isaac Taylor has already done this in a
most masterly fashion in his <i>Fanaticism</i>. But the essence of it is
that wild delusion which leads men (and even women) to fancy
that they can vicariously atone for others&rsquo; sins and &ldquo;make merit,&rdquo;
as the heathen do, for those who are less bold than themselves.
They have fastened themselves down like the poor wretched geese
doomed to furnish <i>pattes-de-fois-gras</i>. They are before the hot
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
fire of zeal and gorged upon indigestible dogmas. Hence their
charity becomes as abnormal as the livers of the geese, and the
moral epicure, alas, finds in them dainties suitable for his depraved
taste!</p>
<p>It would be a grievous injustice to a good man if Damiani
should only bear with us the character of an ardent zealot and not
of a Christian poet. In this last guise he is at his best. Doubtless
he often offends by his Mariolatry, but he will as often charm
by the music of his verse. He may serve also as a convenient
example of this worship of Mary, for in one of his prayers he has
given us the pith and core of that peculiar devotion. It runs
thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O queen of the world, stairs of heaven, throne of God, gate
of paradise, hear the prayers of the poor and despise not the groans
of the wretched. By thee our vows and sighs are borne to the
presence of the Redeemer, that whatsoever things are forbidden to
our merits may obtain, through thee, place in the ears of divine
piety. Erase sins, relieve crimes, raise the fallen, and release
the entangled. Through thee the thorns and shoots of vice are
cut down, and the flowers and ornaments of virtue appear. Appease
with prayers the Judge, the Saviour, whom thou didst produce
in unique childbirth, that He who through thee has become
partaker of our humanity, through thee may also make us partakers
of His divinity. Who with God the Father and the Holy
Spirit liveth and reigneth, world without end. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have given this as an example of his prose. Here is a petition
&ldquo;against a stormy time,&rdquo; composed in that &ldquo;leonine and tailed
rhyme&rdquo; in which Bernard of Cluny, a century later, wrote the <i>De
Contemptu mundi</i>. It commences,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>O miseratrix, O dominatrix, praecipe dictu!</i></p>
<p class="t0">O thou that pitiest, O thou the mightiest, hark to our crying;</p>
<p class="t0">Lest we be beaten down, lest we be smitten down when hail is flying.</p>
<p class="t0">Thine is a priestly breast, O thou that succorest, mother eternal</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore we pray to thee, lest we be stayed from thee, by storm infernal.</p>
<p class="t0">Quiet the tempest-wrack! Give us the sunshine back for our fair weather!</p>
<p class="t0">Lend us clear light again, make the stars bright again where the clouds feather!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p class="t0">Virgin, oh cherish thy friends lest we perish by sickness or anger;</p>
<p class="t0">Drive all these ills away, thou whose love stills away thunder&rsquo;s mad clangor!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>By far the greater part of his hymns are addressed to the Virgin
and to the saints, but there are some others&mdash;the <i>Paule doctor
Egregie</i>, the <i>Paschalis festi gaudium</i>, the <i>Christe sanctorum gloria</i>,
and the two powerful judgment hymns, <i>Gravi me terrore</i> and
<i>O Quam dira, quam horrenda</i>&mdash;which are worthy of note. This
<i>Gravi me terrore</i> of the eleventh century ranks with the <i>Apparebit
repentina</i> of the seventh century. These, together with the <i>Dies
Irae</i> of the fourteenth century, form the great judgment triad of
Latin psalmody.</p>
<p>Yet of all the hymns of that or any later time, nothing approaches
the beauty of the <i>Ad perennis vitae fontem</i>, of which this
Peter Damiani sings. It is born of Augustine&rsquo;s thoughts and
dreams of the heavenly land, and some of its phrases are exquisite
beyond the possibility of translation. When Frater Honestus on
February 23d, 1072, forever left that convent of Fonte Avellana,
whither Dante went upon his last recorded journey, then that
noble landscape might preserve these sixty-one lines of Latin verse
among the choicest treasures of its dell and grove. This was no
lark that sang against the sun with clarion notes calling us to such
praise as rings through the ancient morning hymn of Hilary. It
was the nightingale of Faenza, sending out those thrilling tones
from the midst of the walls which beheld the eager scholar and to
which the weary cardinal had returned to die. Upon his fame it
is set therefore not like the lark&rsquo;s song, but the nightingale&rsquo;s, not
as the flashing diamond, but (in Daniel&rsquo;s very words) &ldquo;as a precious
pearl for our treasury.&rdquo; Mrs. Charles has rendered it into
English with grace and success. Mr. Morgan appends this autograph
note to the version in the copy of his book which is in my
possession: &ldquo;N. B.&mdash;This hymn was printed without revision.
If reprinted the metres will be made <i>equal</i>.&rdquo; He has not attempted
to follow the versification of the original. I know of no
other translation except that of R. F. Littledale in <i>Lyra Mystica</i>.</p>
<p>Another beautiful hymn which was suggested by the prose of
Augustine, and is ascribed to Peter Damiani by Anselm of Canterbury,
who was his younger contemporary, is the <i>Quid tyranne, quid
minaris</i>. It is commonly called</p>

<br /><span class="small">HILDEBERT AND HIS HYMN.</span></h2>
<p>Those who love the &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; of Longfellow will
remember how effectively he has there used the Latin songs and
hymns. Friar Paul is so very like the famous Friar John of
Rabelais, that he is probably copied from that worthy. Indeed
his <i>Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</i>, with its dog-Latin and its broad
satire on the habits of the monks, was a most effective weapon in
the hands of the reformers. There were a great many learned
men who were by no means equally as pious, and who found
their bodily contentment in the cloister. Against these and all
like them came the constant shafts of ridicule or reproach.</p>
<p>But now, when this same Friar Paul &ldquo;tunes his mellow pipe&rdquo;
to a bacchanalian solo in the refectory, we can almost forgive him,
forasmuch as he sings in such capital measure. There is a <i>Gaudiolum</i>&mdash;a
regular merry-making of monks&mdash;down in the cellar;
in which, by the way, Lucifer, disguised in the gray habit, takes
his appropriate place. And when Friar Paul begins on the praise
of good liquor, he parodies the metre and rhyme of the current
religious sequences. Listen to him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Felix venter quem intrabis,</p>
<p class="t0">Felix guttur quod rigabis,</p>
<p class="t0">Felix os quod tu lavabis,</p>
<p class="t0">Et beata labia!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Or, as we may express it in our own language:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Blessed stomach which thou warmest,</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed throat which thou reformest,</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed mouth whose thirst thou stormest,</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed lips to taste of thee!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Here and there Professor Longfellow introduces also into this
&ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; his own renderings from the Latin, in little
transcriptions which are exquisitely felicitous. But presently, in
sharp contrast to the ribald Paul and the dissolute Cuthbert and
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
the rest of the noisy crew in the refectory, he allows us to hear the
song of the pilgrims. They are chanting the Hymn of Hildebert
of Lavardin, Archbishop of Tours:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Me receptet Sion illa,</p>
<p class="t0">Sion David, urbs tranquilla,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus faber auctor lucis,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus portae lignum crucis,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus claves lingua Petri,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus cives semper laeti,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus muri lapis vivus,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus custos Rex festivus.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is the hope of the Holy City of which they are telling:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Me, that Sion soon shall pity&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">David&rsquo;s Sion, peaceful city!</p>
<p class="t0">Whose designer made the morning;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose are gates, the cross adorning;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose keys are to Peter given;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose glad throng are saints in heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose are walls of living splendor;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose a royal, true Defender!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These pilgrims, every now and then, break in with some snatch
of melody from this fine old anthem. And yet there are doubtless
those who never have gone back to see for themselves whence
all this beauty has been taken. But the Hymn of Hildebert
would well repay them if they did.</p>
<p>It is the composition of a man who was the Admirable Crichton
of his time&mdash;Hildebert of Lavardin, a student under Berenger and
Hugo of Cluny. This is the same poet who, with Wichard of
Lyons, is mentioned by Bernard of Cluny in his preface to the
<i>Hora Novissima</i>. He says there, that even these eminent versifiers
had never dared to attempt the measure of his own three thousand
lines. And we have abundant other testimony that Hildebert
was an accomplished orator, a successful controversialist, a brilliant
rhetorician, a poet of ten thousand lines, and the author of
this majestic and beautiful composition. He was born in the
year 1057 (or 1055) at Lavardin, near Vend&ocirc;me, in France, was
first head-master of a school, then an archdeacon, then instructor
in theology and Bishop of Le Mans (1097), and finally (1125),
Archbishop of Tours, from which he derives his name of &ldquo;Turonensis.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
He was of humble origin and not connected with the
celebrated family of Lavardia, except through the accident of his
birthplace being in their vicinity.</p>
<p>Perhaps&mdash;if we follow one scurrilous old biographer&mdash;we may
fancy the holy Hildebert to have been very little of a saint in his
early days. Baronius indeed lends color to the assertion (made
originally by Godfrey, the Dean of Le Mans) that the vices which
Hildebert afterward attacked were matters of personal experience
with himself. A certain coarse assault was undoubtedly made
upon him; but envy and malignity went even to greater lengths
then than now&mdash;and they are not noticeably moderate or truthful
at present. He was a &ldquo;wise and gentle prelate,&rdquo; says Trench,
&ldquo;although not wanting in courage to dare, and fortitude to endure,
when the cause of truth required it.&rdquo; Neander&rsquo;s estimate
of his character (<i>The Life of St. Bernard</i>) is also kind. I doubt,
therefore, whether any such statements can be maintained. But
we all know too well what that age was, for us to be over-enthusiastic
in the defence of our favorites. And still it can truly be said
that Hildebert established his innocence there and then. He
finally died in 1134, and his works, with those of Marbod, were
collected and published in Paris by the Benedictines, at the comparatively
recent date of 1708. His hymn, <i>Oratio devotissima ad
tres Personas Sanctissimae Trinitatis</i>, first appeared in the Appendix
to Archbishop Ussher&rsquo;s <i>De Symbolis</i> (1660), and again was published
by the Norman Jacques Hommey in 1684.</p>
<p>The poem is, as Chancellor Benedict has well said, almost epic
in its completeness. And I can do no better than to summarize
it in his own words&mdash;for he linked his name to it by a translation
which he published in 1867: &ldquo;Its beginning [is] the knowledge
of God&mdash;<i>Fides orthodoxa</i>&mdash;the true creed, as to the Three Persons
of the Holy Trinity, exhibiting their attributes as the foundation
of the Christian character; its middle, the weakness, the trials,
and the temptations of the Christian life, in its progress to perfect
trust and confidence in God and assurance of His final grace; its
end, the joys and glories of the heavenly home of the blessed.&rdquo;
It has been greatly neglected, as any one will find who looks for
it outside of the most recent collections of sacred Latin poetry.
Why this has been so, except because the praise of Mary and of
the saints was more congenial to collectors than a lofty and pure
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
spiritual fervor, it is not easy to discern. Hugo of St. Victor&mdash;Hildebert&rsquo;s
contemporary&mdash;does actually quote six lines, but calls
the author <i>quidam</i>, or, as we would say, &ldquo;somebody,&rdquo; in referring
to these half dozen verses extracted to give point to his own discourse.
Yet Hildebert was in his day a most important personage,
not below the persecution of a king of England, and not
above a quarrel with a king of France. But he and the king were
reconciled at last, and with honor.</p>
<p>That Professor Longfellow is not indebted to Trench&rsquo;s text for
his little quotations, is shown by a curious fact. The <i>Sacred
Latin Poetry</i> of Archbishop (then Dean) Trench was first published
in 1849, and the &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; appeared in Boston in 1851&mdash;the
time seeming to indicate that the poet had been reading in
the small book of the prelate. But Professor March has very
acutely noticed that the Church of England, in the person of its
editor, did a great deal of expurgation, and that the lines</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Cujus claves lingua Petri,</p>
<p class="t0">Cujus cives semper laeti,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>are not included by Trench at all! It was not proper, the Dean
thought, to encourage Romish superstitions, and so Peter and his
keys were omitted. It is not impossible that Longfellow took his
text from a little volume published at Auburn, N. Y., in 1844,
which contains &ldquo;The Hymn of Hildebert and the Ode of Xavier,
with English Versions,&rdquo; probably by Dr. Henry Mills, professor
in the Theological Seminary at Auburn, who also published a
volume of translations of German hymns (1845 and 1856). Dr.
Mills reprints the entire hymn from Ussher, but ignores in his
translation the lines</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Deus pater tantum Dei</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Virgo mater est, sed Dei.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The book is memorable as the first American publication in this
field. Besides the American translations by Dr. Mills and Chancellor
Benedict, there are English versions by Crashaw, by John
Mason Neale, and, best of all, by Herbert Kynaston in the <i>Lyra
Mystica</i> (London, 1869), copied from his <i>Occasional Hymns</i>.</p>
<p>Further to speak of Hildebert, it can be said that he, like others,
took his share of imprisonments, confiscations, and exiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Trench quotes from his poetry two compositions in hexameter
and pentameter&mdash;classic in language, but not always classic in
prosody; and two complete poems, one of which is the famous
hymn, and which commences</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>A et &Omega; magne Deus.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The other is a vision and lament over the Church of Poitiers. Of
this the editor says: &ldquo;I know of no nobler piece of versification,
nor more skilful management of rhyme in the whole circle of
Latin rhymed poetry.&rdquo; It begins</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Nocte quadam, via fessus</i>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>an important hint for a person who wishes to find anything in the
German anthologies, where, as a rule, the indexing is hideous and
the arrangement is heartrending, and the poems are designated,
hit-or-miss, by their initial line.</p>
<p>The poem <i>De Exilio Suo</i>, beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Nuper eram locuples, multisque beatus amicis</i>,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>is an example of the classic measures into which I have tried to
shape my own rendering, although I have copied Hildebert even
in his inaccuracies and repetitions:</p>
<h3>UPON HIS EXILE.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Once I was rich and blessed with friends beyond measure,</p>
<p class="t">And, for awhile, Fortune was prosperous too.</p>
<p class="t0">You would have said that the gods had heard my petition,</p>
<p class="t">And that success had taught me to conquer anew.</p>
<p class="t0">Often I said to myself: &ldquo;What means this wealthy condition?</p>
<p class="t">What does it claim, this swift great store of my gain?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Woe to myself! for faith and confidence perish;</p>
<p class="t">Even my property teaches how I have heaped it in vain!</p>
<p class="t0">Lightly the wing sweeps men and the things that they cherish,</p>
<p class="t">And from the highest station ruin pours down to the plain.</p>
<p class="t0">What you possess to-day, perchance you will lose by to-morrow,</p>
<p class="t">Or, indeed, as you speak, it ceases perhaps to be yours.</p>
<p class="t0">These are the tricks of our fate; and haughtiest kings to their sorrow,</p>
<p class="t">And humblest slaves shall find that no future endures.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, what is Man! and what has he right to inherit?</p>
<p class="t">What is the thing that his wretchedness claims as its own?</p>
<p class="t0">This, this only is man; the years press down on his spirit</p>
<p class="t">Always in saddest condition to utter his final groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p class="t0">It is man&rsquo;s lot to have nothing&mdash;in nakedness coming; and going</p>
<p class="t">Back to his mother&rsquo;s breast to bear her no riches again.</p>
<p class="t0">It is man&rsquo;s lot to decay, his dust on the desert bestowing,</p>
<p class="t">And by sad steps to climb to the pyre of his pain.</p>
<p class="t0">Such is his heirship of good, and here upon earth he may gather</p>
<p class="t">Nothing more certain than these, the spoils of a vanishing fate.</p>
<p class="t0">Riches and honor may greet him, yea, be his servants the rather;</p>
<p class="t">Wealthy at morn though his station, poor shall at night be his state.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor can a man discern the permanent law of possession</p>
<p class="t">Save as he seeks to discover the nature of mortal affairs.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet does God give them their law, conferring them through his concession</p>
<p class="t">Unto the weak by his grace; and their going and coming he shares.</p>
<p class="t0">He by himself alone provides for and manages solely,</p>
<p class="t">Nor does he doubt to provide nor vary in management still.</p>
<p class="t0">For what he sees to be done he does, and his ruling is wholly</p>
<p class="t">Laborless, fixing the form and the time and the bounds of his will.</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, through his zeal for our growth he places our limits and changes</p>
<p class="t">These by his occult laws, himself remaining the same.</p>
<p class="t0">Himself remaining the same, while sickness and health he arranges,</p>
<p class="t">Swaying the world and showing how hope must be set on his name.</p>
<p class="t0">If it be right to trust thee, then, all that thou doest or takest</p>
<p class="t">He is behind it, O Fortune, and he is the source of thy strength.</p>
<p class="t0">Nay, I affirm, O Fortune, however thou fixest or shakest</p>
<p class="t">Thou canst not grieve me, nor overmuch cheer me at length.</p>
<p class="t0">He is almighty and tender, the concord and trust of my treasure;</p>
<p class="t">I shall be his forever, when all his purpose is through!</p>
</div>
<p>It may perhaps be well for us to observe the characteristics of
Hildebert as we discover them in his hymn. They will be found
to be those of an oratorical repetition, and indeed of that &ldquo;fatal
octosyllabic&rdquo; fluency, demonstrated in later times by Skelton, by
Butler, and by Scott. To a certain degree the verse is incapable
of anything large or exultant. But it is admirable for the purpose
to which he puts it. Indeed, I knew no better way, when Hildebert&rsquo;s
best admirer passed from this to a nobler world, than to
express my own sadness in similar Latin; and I venture to close
this chapter with the closing lines of that tribute. Mr. E. C. Benedict
made it his happiest recreation to turn the strains of these
ancient singers into modern verse. And it seemed fitting that he
should be commemorated in the very rhythm he loved so well:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Vir honeste, vir praeclare!</p>
<p class="t0">Tibi quidvis possim dare</p>
<p class="t0">His versiculis confeci;</p>
<p class="t0">Hic, coronam superjeci.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p class="t0">Autem, illic, lux perennis</p>
<p class="t0">Proferet floresque pennis</p>
<p class="t0">Aves pictis puro die;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Nihil deest, O tu pie!</p>
<p class="t0">Tu qui terra serus abis</p>
<p class="t0">Christum unice laudabis.</p>
<p class="t0">Vale! quia non moraris;</p>
<p class="t0">Ave! quia nunc laetaris!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Unto thee sincere and worthy</p>
<p class="t0">Here I bring a tribute earthy.</p>
<p class="t0">In these verses I have pressed it;</p>
<p class="t0">Here upon thy tomb I rest it.</p>
<p class="t0">But thyself, in light eternal</p>
<p class="t0">Seest flowers; and birds supernal</p>
<p class="t0">Brightly flit through sunny portals&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou dost lack no joy of mortals!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou who late from us dost sever</p>
<p class="t0">There shall praise the Lord forever!</p>
<p class="t0">Farewell! for thou wilt not linger;</p>
<p class="t0">Hail! for thou art there a singer!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, when once these old monks &ldquo;soared beyond chains and
prison&rdquo;&mdash;when they dreamed by night and talked by day of the
land that is very far off&mdash;they drew to them all loving hearts from
the most distant ages. Doubtless Hildebert knew&mdash;and rejoiced
in knowing&mdash;that his aspirations had been caught in a modern
city and by a weary lawyer, who found rest and peace in their
strain. And doubtless in the perfectness of the present rejoicing
they both see and love what they once sighed to obtain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX.</span></h2>
<p>There is no lack of material for a copious account of Bernard
of Clairvaux. He was a man to become distinguished in any age
of the world, and he took and maintained the highest place of his
time. His faults are as patent as his virtues. But, if he had not
these faults, he would never have enjoyed certain kinds of success.
His very austerity was a merit when it held his keen intellect
steadily to its mark. And his intolerance, narrowness, ambition,
and love of dialectics, were themselves a part of the great demand
which his generation made upon him.</p>
<p>I shall be responsible here simply for a condensation and compilation
of facts, a very different proceeding from that which is
usually needed. In the case of almost all these hymn-writers the
materials are so slight and meagre as to require large research; in
this case one is overwhelmed with riches. I do not profess to say
how many lives of Bernard have been written, but I know of a
goodly number; and no history of his time has failed to give
attention to so prominent a figure in religion and in statecraft.</p>
<p>He was singularly situated in point of time and place. Born in
Burgundy, not far from Dijon, of a fighting family, who owned a
castle and were well represented in the wars, he saw the light in
1091. His father Tesselin was a man who had learned in the
school of Christ to be more careful not to wrong his neighbor than
not to be wronged by him. His mother Alith was the model
chatelaine of the times, full of kindness to the poor and helpfulness
to the needy. He was born at the <i>omphalos</i> and centre of
the Middle Ages. Peter the Hermit whirled along his wild battalions
almost beside his very cradle. The little lad of four years
must have seen the strange excited throngs, with their red crosses
and their banners, and in the dust of their passing and in the
chants of their praise, he must have been conscious of a certain
enthusiasm which was to run throughout his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>For several years this news was to men the staple of all conversation.
The body of their own duke was finally brought back
from Palestine to his ancient heritage, and laid, by his own desire,
in the cemetery of the poor monks of Citeaux. There, in this
comparatively recent monastery near Dijon, he had selected his
last home, in preference to many more opulent and renowned
establishments. The son of Burgundy&rsquo;s vassal Tesselin beheld
this and other incidents. His brothers went to the wars with the
next duke, but he himself grew less and less inclined toward such
pursuits. Books formed his world. His cell was afterward said
to be stored with them; and he obtained easily the credit of being
the best instructed person of his time in the Bible and in the
works of the fathers of the Church.</p>
<p>And already these tendencies were aroused in the youth of eighteen
or nineteen years who had begun the old-fashioned austerities
on his own account. We are not surprised to find him neck-deep
in ice-water; stung into intellectual vigor by the recent victory of
Abelard over William of Champeaux; aroused into an actual
preaching fervor, in which he denounces the sins of the age;
continually mindful of his dead mother Alith&rsquo;s prayers, and
finally resolved upon entering the monastic order and upon carrying
all his friends and relations with him.</p>
<p>That singular mastery of other minds, which was his at every
period henceforth, now displayed itself. It did not matter that
his brother Guido had a wife and family; nor that his brother
Gerard loved to fight a good deal better than he loved to pray.
Into the cloister they must go! Gerard indeed was something
after the manner of Lot&rsquo;s wife, disposed to look back. But his
brother touched him on the side, and by some strange prescience
or happy guess, predicted to him a spear-wound, which actually
happened. On being thus remarkably warned, the soldier relented
as they carried him wounded off the field, and cried, &ldquo;I turn
monk, monk of Citeaux.&rdquo; This was the Gerard over whom,
long afterward, Bernard delivered that touching sermon, where he
branched out from the Song of Solomon (1:5) to declare that
this body &ldquo;is not the mansion of the citizen, nor the house of the
native, but either the soldier&rsquo;s tent or the traveller&rsquo;s inn;&rdquo; and
then poured forth his full heart in a tide of uncontrollable and
lofty grief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>So the youth marched into the poor monastery of Citeaux,
where scanty food, rough clothing, harsh surroundings and occasional
epidemic disorders had nearly disheartened and broken up
the company of monks. Stephen Harding, their English abbot,
was proudly indifferent to all patronage; but he was not so blind
as not to perceive that Bernard, with thirty captives of the bow
and spear of his eloquence, was a valuable addition to a depleted
community.</p>
<p>These Cistercians, then and always, were rigidists. Up they
got at two in the morning to prayer and &ldquo;matins;&rdquo; and for full
two hours were busy, in a cold dark chapel, over them. Then,
with the first dawn of light, out again to &ldquo;lauds.&rdquo; Before this
service, and after it, the monk&rsquo;s time was fairly his own; but at
two o&rsquo;clock he dined, at nightfall he had &ldquo;vespers,&rdquo; and at
six or eight (according to the season) came &ldquo;compline,&rdquo; and
then immediately the dormitory and bed. Such was the life,
with a little more of it on Sundays, and with sermons interspersed
at intervals. There is no mention of breakfast or supper!</p>
<p>And in such a life the ecstatic, mystical character of Bernard
rose into visions and prophecies. His body was nearly subjugated,
and his taste, and, indeed, all his senses, appeared to have deserted
him. He watched, he dug, he hewed and carried wood; he kept
the very letter, and more than the letter of his monastic rule.
And yet, as Morison acutely observes, this very abstraction from
people and things gave him that delight in nature from which, so
often in the future, he was to catch the illustration or the inspiration
of his discourse. &ldquo;Beeches and oaks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had ever
been his best teachers in the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Citeaux (suddenly become prosperous) must colonize;
and who so fit to lead the swarm from the gates and found the new
hive as this same Bernard? Into his hands Abbot Stephen puts
the cross, and he and his twelve companions march solemnly
across the interdicted boundaries of their little Cistercian home,
and nearly a hundred miles to the northward. There he chooses
a place which exhibits, as Bernard&rsquo;s actions generally do, the far-sighted
sagacity which takes mean and worthless matters and makes
them what, with right handling, they are able to become. It is a
valley&mdash;the &ldquo;Valley of Wormwood.&rdquo; It is grown up with underbrush
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
and is a haunt of robbers. But here, with the river Aube
winding down between the hills, with the hills themselves capable
of culture, and with the future of this little vale revealed to his
prophetic eye, he sets his cloister and calls it Clairvaux&mdash;&ldquo;Fair
Valley,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Brightdale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish that I could quote the beautiful picture that Vaughan
(<i>Hours with the Mystics</i>, Book V., chap. 1) has given of this fine
enterprise. We should see Bernard and his monks chopping and
binding fagots; planting vines and trees of goodly fruit; rearing
their cloistral buildings, when the time arrived, out of the very
materials about them, and so steadily transforming purgatory
into paradise. There should we see the river bending its great
shoulders to the wheels that drive fulling-mill and grist-mill; or
toiling for them in their tannery, or filling their <i>caldarium</i>. We
should see the monks at vintage or at harvest; pressing the clusters
from yonder hill, or gathering the hay from yonder meadow.
And everywhere throughout this busy, energetic life, we should
behold the wasted figure of their chief&mdash;austere, sincere, severe.
And we should feel that unaccountable personality&mdash;that intrinsic,
magnetic, controlling quality which made this the man above all
others to be the opposer of schismatics, the counsellor of kings,
the establisher of popes, and the preacher of the Second Crusade.
Clairvaux was his kingdom, and from Clairvaux he ruled the
mediaeval world.</p>
<p>His personal appearance was in keeping with this idea&mdash;it was
the evident cause of an evident effect. He was taller than the
middle height and exceedingly thin. His complexion was &ldquo;clear,
transparent, red-and-white;&rdquo; and always he had some color in
his wasted face. His beard was reddish, and&mdash;according to his
ancestral derivation, called <i>Sorus</i> or &ldquo;yellow-haired&rdquo;&mdash;his own
hair was light and perhaps tawny. This beard grows whiter in the
course of years, and these hollow cheeks glow with the enthusiasm
of the orator as he speaks. Then he is at his best! He flings
aside all feebleness; he disregards every consideration except the
truth; he flashes and glitters as the tremendous squadrons of his
brilliant logic, or still more brilliant exhortation, press down upon
the listening soul. He had indeed a perfect confidence in himself,
in his methods, and in his ultimate success. He was like a
modern ocean steamer, iron-hulled, steam-driven, sharp-prowed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
cutting through all storms without detention, and riding the wildest
waves in his triumphant course to victory.</p>
<p>There is in Bernard of Clairvaux a most singular combination
of the dreamer and the man of affairs. Vaughan has too admirably
condensed the story of these interruptions and occupations,
for me to avoid quoting, at least this much, from his capital
monograph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struggling Christendom,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;sent incessant monks
and priests, couriers and men-at-arms to knock and blow horns at
the gate of Clairvaux Abbey; for Bernard, and none but he, must
come out and fight that audacious Abelard; Bernard must decide
between rival popes, and cross the Alps, time after time, to quiet
tossing Italy; Bernard alone is the hope of fugitive Pope and
trembling Church; he only can win back turbulent nobles, alienated
people, recreant priests, when Arnold of Brescia is in arms at
Rome, and when Catharists, Petrobrusians, Waldenses and
heretics of every shade, threaten the hierarchy on either side the
Alps; and at the preaching of Bernard the Christian world pours
out to meet the disaster of a new crusade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet with all this he is a profound scholar, and his comments
on Scripture are of a mystical, and often of a serenely spiritual and
thoughtful kind, as though no intrusion could jar the harmony
and poise of his soul. His was that strange contradiction of
nature which found its calm in tumult and its ecstasy in conflict.
Obstructions pass away.</p>
<p>Like that later mystic, Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg), there
are no hindrances in his communion with the unseen world; he
could, perhaps, do as Novalis did when Sophie K&uuml;hn died. For
the poor fellow records in his diary: &ldquo;Much noise in the house.
I went to her grave and had a few wild moments of joy.&rdquo; And
of him also Just declares: &ldquo;No spirit-dream was too high, no
business detail too low;&rdquo; for Novalis in 1799 was &ldquo;Assessor and
Law-adviser to the Salt Mines of Thuringia.&rdquo; Pegasus in harness
appears no worse a contradiction than a mystic in a salt-pan, or
a Bernard epistolizing the Count of Champagne about a drove of
stolen pigs.</p>
<p>Prose and poetry, poetry and prose! And yet the brain and
soul that can do good work in the one are by no means disqualified
for the other; and your truest mystics are not likely to wear
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
long hair and talk raving nonsense among impractical neologists.
For Bernard, even though he made converts wherever he went,
and drew increasing numbers into cloister walls, exerted a potent
and prevalent influence upon his time. He is one of the lighthouses,
as we sail down the coast of the Middle Ages; and not
until we pass him and his compeers, do the real darkness and the
dull ignorance, the shoals and the unmarked rocks appear, ready
to wreck the ventures of the mind. How gladly one would linger
over these fascinating incidents in this remarkable career! The
man&rsquo;s life was expressed in some of his own aphorisms. They are
such as these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no truer wretchedness than a false joy.&rdquo; &ldquo;He does
not please who pleases not himself.&rdquo; &ldquo;You will give to your
voice the voice of virtue if you have first persuaded yourself of
what you would persuade others.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hold the middle line unless
you wish to miss the true method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the maxims of an orator as well as of a statesman.
And the junction of imagination, analysis, logic, fervor, and faith,
made this man what he was. Already he had tried his wings in
preaching to his own monks at morning and evening; and they
had listened to him as though he had come from another world.
He dealt with the great and vital questions of the moral nature.
Like the best of our modern preachers, he aimed to sustain the
soul, to arouse and to cheer it, and to bid it press forward to a
victory which he himself foresaw. He might have said of such
aspiring saints as surrounded him what Roscoe says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I see, or the glory blinds me</p>
<p class="t">Of a soul divinely fair,</p>
<p class="t0">Peace after great tribulation</p>
<p class="t">And victory hung in the air.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He felt, with Lacordaire, that the Gospel had a new meaning,
when he discovered that it was intended for the comfort of the
human heart. He was at one with his monks; and as he reached
out toward the social life about him, and toward the turbid torrents
of politics and ecclesiasticism over which he must throw the
bridge of charity or of faith, he simply transferred the Clairvaux
method into the affairs of men.</p>
<p>It was an age of destruction, and into it he was casting the salt
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
of the Gospel, hoping at least to make it salvable. Around his
life needless legends and superstitious traditions have combined to
cluster, but the real Bernard is distinct from both. He never
relaxed his grip upon himself or upon others. And while this is
not yet the place to speak of the famous controversy with Abelard,
it may be properly said that Bernard saw tendencies in that philosophy
which were genuinely dangerous; and that he defeated
them because truth (however narrow and selfishly employed) is
always stronger than error. Such was also his power in preaching
the crusade in 1145, when he was about fifty-five years of age.
It sprang from the quenchless fire of his zeal, as when at Vezelai,
standing by the side of Louis VII., he caused such enthusiasm in
the crowd beneath, that he did nothing so long as he remained in
the town but make crosses for them to wear in sign of their holy
purpose.</p>
<p>He had lived to see the Knights Templars, which had received
his own especial approval, become one of the most famous orders
on the globe. The Knights Hospitallers had been incorporated
in 1113, and the Templars were founded in 1118 by Hugo de
Paganis and others. But in 1128, at the Council of Troyes, there
were but nine of them, all told, to keep their vow of &ldquo;chastity,
obedience, and poverty,&rdquo; to &ldquo;guard the passes and roads against
robbers,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;watch over the safety of pilgrims.&rdquo; Hugo
then appealed to Bernard, and by his influence the council recognized
this weak thing, destined so soon to be a mighty force, and
which combined two of the strongest of our instincts&mdash;that to fight
and that to pray. And now as in his old age he saw the corruption
which was creeping into it and into other agencies on which
his heart had been set, he relaxed no atom of his vigilance. He
had seen the failure of his crusade, but it did not much affect
him. His thoughts were now of heaven, and his watching was
that he might be prepared to enter its gates. His principal friends
had all died; Suger, in 1150, Theobald of Champagne, in 1152,
and Pope Eugenius, his loved disciple, in 1153.</p>
<p>It was in this year that Bernard also made himself ready to go.
On January 12th he said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and then, raising up
what his admirers were wont to call his &ldquo;dove-like&rdquo; eyes, he
prayed that God&rsquo;s will might be done. And so, quietly and
peacefully, he passed away. He has left behind him much as an
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
ecclesiast, but more as a poet. I hold Bernard to be the real
author of the modern hymn&mdash;the hymn of faith and worship.
The poetry of Faber, which is now so near to the heart of the
Church, is peculiarly in this key. The <i>Salve Caput cruentatum</i>
came to us through Paul Gerhardt, and has become (through the
translation of Dr. J. W. Alexander, a man of kindred spirit with
Bernard) our</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O sacred head, now wounded.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Gerhardt&rsquo;s own hymn-writing&mdash;the most efficient, except Luther&rsquo;s,
in the German tongue&mdash;is wonderfully affected by Bernard.
The <i>Jesu dulcis memoria</i> was rendered by Count Zinzendorf and
became famous among those spiritual souls, the Moravians. And
Edward Caswell&rsquo;s translations&mdash;as I have already noticed&mdash;are
supremely fine in spirit and in expression. I shall not attempt here
what has been so capitally done already. The Church universal
has made Bernard her own; and the very translations of his verses
have been half-inspired. And while we sing,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus, the very thought of thee</p>
<p class="t0">With sweetness fills my breast,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>we shall sing &ldquo;with the spirit and with the understanding,&rdquo; the
very strain that the Abbot of Clairvaux was sent on earth to teach!
They canonized him in 1174&mdash;but it is better to have written a
song for all saints than to be found in any breviary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">ABELARD.</span></h2>
<p>From the foreground of the waving banners and the flashing
arms of the Crusaders, of the dark throng of the chanting monks,
and of feudal pageantry and glitter&mdash;and from that background
of dead uniformity which equally characterized those mediaeval times&mdash;emerges
a figure unique and notable. It is that of a man in
the prime and pride of life&mdash;lofty in stature, handsome in face,
captivating in address. He is already a tried debater and an unsurpassed
logician. He has Aristotle at the tip of his tongue; he
has read much and thought a little, and his ambition is great.</p>
<p>Such a man came one day into the lecture hall of William of
Champeaux at Paris. It was in the early part of the twelfth century,
and William was the most celebrated teacher of the period,
his &ldquo;doctrine of universals&rdquo; being accepted almost as though it
were inspired. But this morning, while the master lectured and
the disciples drank in his words without criticism or debate, the
visitor stirred uneasily in his place. When the lecture closed he
availed himself of the usual freedom to ask some questions. To
William&rsquo;s dogmatic answers the stranger in his turn proposed
shrewd difficulties. It was no longer the harmony of teacher and
taught, but the clash of two rival minds maintaining opposite
systems of logic. And in that short struggle William the Archdeacon
went down before the free lance of Peter Abelard, the
rustic challenger from Palais (Le Pallet) in Brittany. And from
that agitation went out the widening circles whose story we are
now to note, and whose latest ripples break faintly on a tomb in
P&egrave;re-la-Chaise visited by thousands of modern tourists. Few tales
are sadder or more suggestive.</p>
<p>The name of Abelard is variously spelled. It appears in divers
authorities as Abelard, Abaelard, Abaielardus, Abailard, Abaillard,
Abelhardus, and Abeillard. The true name (on the authority of
Ch. de R&eacute;musat) was, however, not Abelard, but Beranger or
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
Berenger; and the future controversialist was christened Pierre or
Peter. His birthplace is near Nantes, the house being represented
a few years ago by a square brier-grown ruin back of the church.
The date of his birth is given as 1079&mdash;a period when the world
was feudal and military. But this lad was born for debate and
not for battle. It may even be seriously doubted if he ever possessed
much physical courage of a sort to stand the rough shock
of actual warfare. He preferred the method of those who intermeddle
among metaphysical subtleties to those who must keep
sword edges sharp and armor furbished. His delight was to dispute,
to be engaged in undertakings</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Whose chief devotion lies</p>
<p class="t0">In odd perverse antipathies;</p>
<p class="t0">In falling out with that or this</p>
<p class="t0">And finding somewhat still amiss.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In those days not to be a warrior was to be&mdash;almost of compulsion&mdash;a
monk. But Abelard&rsquo;s independence forbade the second
as his disputatious spirit had forbidden the first. He would
neither risk his neck in the wars nor his opinions in the cloister.
Instead of these he preferred the irregular combats of the scholar,
and Bayle&mdash;with a touch of poetry&mdash;beholds him as he comes
shining out of Brittany &ldquo;darting syllogisms on every side.&rdquo; Such
was Peter Abelard&mdash;vain, handsome, opinionated, bound to swear
by no master, a mighty voice crying in the desert of the Dark
Ages for &ldquo;free speech and free thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expedition to Paris hurt neither his reputation nor his purse.
He arrived at perihelion as quickly as a comet. William of
Champeaux&mdash;having first pushed him off and forced him to lecture
on his own account at Melun and Corbeil&mdash;found that he returned
like a cork thrust under water. The man&rsquo;s buoyant, aggressive
self-reliance, not to say self-conceit, was never contented with an
inferior place. And while Alberic and Littulf and some of the
older and more staid of his pupils held with William, it was plain
that the popular favor inclined to the other side. The younger
men were all for Abelard. The &ldquo;doctrine of universals&rdquo; was exploded
as if with some of Friar Bacon&rsquo;s &ldquo;villainous saltpetre,&rdquo;
and doubtless the loss was small enough to mankind. His principal
fort being taken, there was nothing left for the opposing general
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
but a masterly retreat. Hence, by a convenient arrangement,
combining several advantages, Guillaume des Champeaux became
Bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne. And it was, of course, beneath the
dignity of a bishop to hold lectures or to engage in logical controversies!</p>
<p>But, as generally happens, a sand-bag substitute was put in the
bishop&rsquo;s place; and Abelard came back to open a school on Mt.
St. Genevieve and to bombard this professor. The battle was
short and decisive, for the next we learn of this nameless champion
of a defeated cause, he is absolutely enrolled as a humble follower
of the great logician. This is but a fair sample of the general success
which attended the new ideas. Everywhere they gained currency,
attracting inquiry, arousing envy, awaking ecclesiastical
suspicion, and inflaming the hatred of his defeated opponents.</p>
<p>About this time of inception and premonition, say 1113,
Abelard undertook to examine the instruction given by William&rsquo;s
teacher, Anselm of Laon, who there vegetated as dean of the
cathedral church. We must not confuse his name with that of
the great Archbishop of Canterbury, whose method and science
have outlasted the most of his contemporaries, and whom Neander
styles &ldquo;the Augustine of the twelfth century.&rdquo; Had he been
the teacher and Abelard the pupil, history might have made a different
record. A profounder and a more reverent line of thought
might have affected the acute and daring mind of the rising dialectician.
And, above every other consideration, the new philosophy
might have contained those elements of religion whose absence
neutralized for centuries that wholesome independence which held
mere dogmatism cheap as compared to the sacred light of truth.
It would, indeed, have been well if such an Anselm had been at
Laon, but the dean was a weak and futile person. And so it was
inevitable that Abelard should again be in trouble and almost in
disgrace, but even in his pathetic <i>Historia Calamitatum</i> the pupil
did not forget to satirize his master. &ldquo;He was that sort of a
man,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that if any went to him being uncertain he returned
more uncertain still.... When he lit a fire he filled his
house with smoke, but he did not brighten it with light.&rdquo; He
adds, sarcastically, that Anselm&rsquo;s philosophy always suggested to
his mind the story of the fig-tree that our Lord cursed because it
bore plenty of leaves and no fruit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Abelard himself, however, was a genuine educator, and many
bishops and other ecclesiastics, with nineteen cardinals and two
popes, came from the ranks of his pupils. He loved liberty, although
he loved it to that extent to which his own will&mdash;and no
other authority, human or divine&mdash;restricted it. In this he differed
from Anselm of Canterbury, who loved liberty, not according
to license but according to law. Mere freedom to inquire, to
complain, or to theorize, does not invariably carry with it profitable
results. And Abelard&mdash;whose very freedom was in itself a noble
revelation to the shackled intellects of his age&mdash;committed the
grave error of supposing that the sweep of a free hand would certainly
give lines of beauty and forms of grace. Something deeper
than the mere distaste of false opinions is needful for this. Art,
meditation, truth&mdash;all must lie beneath the O of Giotto or the
masterly strokes of Apelles. And our rhetorician would have
done well to have confined himself to the <i>Trivium</i>&mdash;grammar,
rhetoric, and dialectics. When he undertook theology he first
quarrelled with Anselm of Laon, and next he encountered all
Christendom and Bernard of Clairvaux. His was the fatal
blunder of every &ldquo;free inquirer&rdquo; who forgets reverence, and who,
in his pride of intellect, may likely fall as the angels fell. Surely
no Lucifer ever plunged more swiftly down from heaven&rsquo;s battlements
than did poor Peter Abelard from the dizzy height of his sudden success.</p>
<p>This is no place to criticise his &ldquo;system,&rdquo; if system it can be
properly called. The <i>Sic et Non</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Yes and No&rdquo;&mdash;his most
famous work, is really a mere challenge. He quotes the Bible
against the Fathers and the Fathers against the Bible, touching
on deep tideways and bogs and quicksands which he never
attempts to ford, fathom, or bridge. The Arians, Sabellians,
Nestorians and Pelagians are resuscitated in these pages. He
flings their doubts before us like a gauntlet cast into the arena of
debate. One may choose which side he will take. Such a man,
arising in the nineteenth century and claiming sympathy with
Christianity, would be by some suspected as a secret enemy and
his vanity would loosen his armor for the entrance of many a
venomed shaft. His genuine ardor would be misunderstood and
his opinions would be heavily attacked before they could deploy
at their full strength. If this be true to-day how infinitely more true
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
must it have been of an age narrower, more illiterate, and with an
arm which wielded not in vain the sword of excision against heretics!</p>
<p>This, then, was the man who in the prime of manhood and at
the topmost peak of prosperity found himself with money in his
pocket, in Paris, and his own master. He had not yet said of
the dogmas of Mother Church as Luther said of Tetzel, &ldquo;By
God&rsquo;s help I will go down and beat a hole in your drum.&rdquo;
Hitherto he had safely kept to Aristotle&mdash;at once the blessing and
the bane of Middle-Age reasoners&mdash;and he had the vainglorious
sense that five thousand students hung breathless on his words.
He considered himself upon the firmest footing that one could
desire, and behold, he fell!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;damned spot&rdquo; of Abelard&rsquo;s character is that which, after
all, has insured his fame. And, since it is indispensable, a few
sentences must exhibit it in its repulsive ugliness. Fortunately,
or unfortunately, we do not need the help of any other biographer
than his own bitter soul. His <i>Historia Calamitatum</i> is the sufficient
history. In this he tells us that his life had been previously irreproachable
and of the strictest moral correctness. Now, however,
he began to &ldquo;let himself go&rdquo;&mdash;how far, or how fast, it is of no
use for us to investigate. But Fulbert, the Canon of the Cathedral
of Notre Dame, had a perfect Hypatia for a niece, and to this lady
Abelard&rsquo;s gaze was turned.</p>
<p>She was eighteen, and there was an irresistible charm about her,
as of some fragrant white lily. She was a woman fit to lend grace
and beauty to prosaic surroundings. And Abelard has the unspeakable
audacity to declare that he, a man of thirty-eight, deliberately
selected this pure and perfect flower and meant to take it
for himself. Not to marry; for the truth demands that we should
perceive his own thorough appreciation of the fact that marriage
would sink him out of the ranks of scholars into those of tradesmen
and would be the death-blow to his ambition. Not to marry;
for it was a bad age, and sin sometimes clothed itself in the cowl
of the monk and the robe of the prelate, and such a sin was better
forgiven than such a blunder. Let all contemporaneous history
bear witness! For every account of the lives of Heloise and
Abelard reveals the impossibility of passing these unpleasant facts
without notice or comment. On this pivot turns the golden
world of that deathless love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>So the avaricious Fulbert took Abelard to dwell in his own
house, and gave his niece&rsquo;s education entirely into his care, and,
as her teacher himself expresses it, delivered her &ldquo;like a lamb to
a hungry wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heloise was probably the better educated of the two. She was
the child of unknown parents. Bayle asserts that she was the
daughter of a priest, and his facilities and laboriousness respecting
such abstruse particulars no one will question. The authority
from which he is possibly quoting, says that this priest was John
&ldquo;Somebody&rdquo; (<i>nescio cujus</i>) and a canon of the same cathedral
with Fulbert at Paris. Doubtless the trace of her ancestry is
utterly lost to us beyond these meagre items. Even Fulbert&rsquo;s
alleged relationship has been questioned. But the scholarship of
Heloise speaks for itself in a terse, sparkling Latin style, which is
as pleasant beside Abelard&rsquo;s lumbering sentences as a bright
mountain brook beside a turbid and turbulent stream. Count de
Bussy-Rabutin&mdash;no mean critic&mdash;has put on record that he never
read more elegant Latin. She also understood Greek and Hebrew,
with neither of which, strange to say, was Abelard acquainted.
And at first blush it would seem that the teacher should have been
the pupil.</p>
<p>Absolute justice requires that the ugly and disgraceful slurs in
the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>, and even in the correspondence, should
not be overlooked. Here is what will serve for a fair example.
He says of her, <i>Quae cum per faciem non esset infima, per abundantiam
litterarum erat suprema</i>&mdash;while she was not exactly the worst-looking
of them, she was the best educated; and therefore he
selected her! The <i>spretae injuria formae</i> never went further than
this. But this is by no means the solitary instance of that low
snarl in which the currish nature of the Breton rustic now and then
indulged.</p>
<p>What, then, could have been the spell by which this charming
woman drew Christendom after her? Popes and bishops called
her &ldquo;beloved daughter,&rdquo; priests entitled her &ldquo;sister,&rdquo; and all
laymen laid claim to her as &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; If she were not so beautiful
as some authorities positively state, she must certainly have
been marvellously captivating. But chiefest of her many graces
was her crowning loyalty and love. It showed itself in perfect
sympathy, in entire self-devotion. Michelet, indeed, has observed
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
that the legend of Abelard and Heloise is all that has survived in
France out of the story of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Nor has the unanimity of literary judgment upon these lovers
been less remarkable than the interest which they have inspired.
With one voice Abelard is condemned and with one voice Heloise
is extolled. &ldquo;She was,&rdquo; says a brilliant writer, &ldquo;a great, heroic
woman, one of those formed out of the finest clay of humanity.&rdquo;
&ldquo;With the Grecian fire,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;she had the Roman
firmness.&rdquo; And even the rude picture which the mechanical
touch of Alexander Pope has painted, leaves to us in the &ldquo;Epistle
of Heloise&rdquo; a trace of the same beauty, and affords one line&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And graft my love immortal on thy fame&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>which only needs to be reversed in order to be prophetic. Morison&rsquo;s
tribute is both nobler and more acute, for he testifies, &ldquo;She
walked through life with ever-reverted glances on the glory of her
girlish love.&rdquo; It was the same thought which Dante&mdash;after
Boethius&mdash;puts into the lips of Francesca&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There is no greater sorrow</p>
<p class="t0">Than to be mindful of the happy time</p>
<p class="t0">In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Nay, it is even the very cameo out of Tennyson:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As when a soul laments, which hath been blessed,</p>
<p class="t">Desiring what is mingled with past years,</p>
<p class="t0">In yearnings that can never be expressed</p>
<p class="t">By sighs, or groans, or tears.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This is the heart which Abelard won. Winning it he won, and
forever held, the woman whose it was. From that moment she
merged her whole existence in his with a complete and utter
abandonment of self, to the perfectness of which let her epistles
from the Paraclete bear testimony. Across this story of undeviating
devotion Abelard&rsquo;s vanity, pride, and coarseness are written
with smears and stains, like an illiterate monk who blots his comments
upon a precious missal full of saints and angels. For, first
of his offences, he revealed this love of his by really becoming a
troubadour. He composed verses in the Romance tongue, recounting
their loves, and set them to such stirring tunes that all
the world was soon singing them. Hence grew the legend that
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
the &ldquo;Romance of the Rose&rdquo; (<i>Roman de la Rose</i>) was his composition.
It undoubtedly contains their story, but it was not his
work; it belongs to William de Loris and Jean de Meung. But,
as for Heloise, she was delighted. What would have been a crown
of sorrow to other women was to her a crown of joy. She even
announced to Abelard &ldquo;with the utmost exultation&rdquo; the advent
of that unhappy being christened Astrolabe and destined to pass
his forsaken and lonely existence shut up in a cloister. That
people sang of this love; that it went to the ends of the earth;
that nothing could prevent its being known&mdash;these were the happinesses
of Heloise. Of the merit of the songs we cannot ourselves
decide. They were originally anonymous, and only those familiar
with the crabbed French of that period may hope to find them
again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though the lectures suffered, and the students saw,
and all Paris smiled, Fulbert was totally in the dark. This condition
of affairs was predestined to come to an end, and it came
in storm and anger. Abelard saw himself forced, against his will,
to marry secretly. It was a sting to his egotism that ever rankled.
It served, though, to pacify Fulbert and the rest of the relations;
and being too glad and too loose-tongued to keep this handsome
alliance from the public they presently told everybody. Heloise,
thereupon, fearing for Abelard&rsquo;s ambitious schemes, did not shrink
from a point-blank falsehood. She denied the marriage. She
had been in Brittany and was now at Argenteuil, of which she
was by and by to become the abbess. And she added to her
denial the self-abnegating sentiment that Abelard, who was created
for all mankind, ought not to be sacrificed by &ldquo;bondage to a
woman.&rdquo; It was worthy of her who so admired the &ldquo;philosophic
Aspasia,&rdquo; and whose tutor and lover had done what he could to
make her as &ldquo;free from superstition&rdquo; as himself. Her moral
ideas were what he taught her, and he could not unteach them.</p>
<p>Among the complaisant and agreeable nuns of Argenteuil she
now resided. It was but a few miles from Paris. Her husband
frequently went thither, and in a short time thereafter she was
enrolled as a novice. The fact aroused her relatives, and their
mutterings became ominous; Fulbert, especially, taking this act in
high dudgeon, as though it meant the premeditated repudiation
of his niece. Their anger did not stop at words, but, knowing
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
Abelard&rsquo;s popularity, and fearing to attack him during the day,
they bribed his valet and assaulted him by night in his own apartment.</p>
<p>It was this blow which flung Abelard from heaven to hell. His
hitherto impregnable attitude; his fierce zeal for his opinions;
his hopes of a new philosophy which should make his name immortal,
all vanished before it as spider-webs break before a sword.
And when, conscious that he was no more a god and a hero, but
an insulted and defeated man, he rose from his bed of pain, the
prospect was not improved. The outpoured indignation of
bishops and canons and clergy&mdash;the lamentations of the women
and the students&mdash;did not appease him. A whisper was in his
soul like that of Haman&rsquo;s wife. Mordecai, the despised, was coming
to the kingdom and the Agagite was doomed.</p>
<p>There were reasons which led him to think of seeking aid from
the Pope against his enemies. But Fulk of Deuil, his good
friend, advised him not to try it. &ldquo;You have no money,&rdquo; said
honest, plain spoken Fulk, &ldquo;and what can you do at Rome without
money?&rdquo; It was bitter truth. Yet the Abb&eacute; Migne, forgetting
the much worse things Bernard had said of the Roman
Curia in the treatise <i>De Consideratione</i>, exscinds the passage from
Fulk&rsquo;s letter on the ground that it would cause &ldquo;scandal to
Catholic ears.&rdquo; Edification first, truth afterward, if at all!</p>
<p>Therefore, with a poisoned soul, he sought the Abbey of St.
Denis to hide himself from the gaze of the world. To a man so
proud a life without imperial power was a living death. Yet from
those walls he issues his edict that Heloise shall take the veil.
His vanity led him to carry out the original cause of hostility even
to its unalterable result. But Heloise, whatever she might have
thought or felt, marched with lofty resignation to her fate. Quoting
aloud&mdash;as his confession pitifully recalls&mdash;the words of Cornelia
to Pompey from the &ldquo;Pharsalia&rdquo; of Lucan, she takes the vows.
Never was there less of religion in such a ceremony! Henceforth
she walks like the moon in distant brightness, coming to meet us
down the ages as comes the Queen Louise of Gustav Richter&rsquo;s
superb picture. She is transfigured by her self-forgetting love, and
&ldquo;all that is left of her,&rdquo; in the best and truest sense, is now &ldquo;pure
womanly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Abelard at St. Denis the case was different. He found
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
the monks worldly and dissolute and he reproved them. The
effect was similar to the case of Lot&mdash;the reformer departed with
all his belongings. He then renewed his old lectures. His
scholars followed him to Maisoncelle, where, in their avidity of
knowledge, they overcrowded every resource of shelter and food.
He offered them that fascinating combination, dialectics and
divinity. Like the saltpetre and the charcoal these were harmless
when apart and explosive when together, particularly if you add
the sulphurous heart which now smoked in his bosom. A harsh
and vindictive tone was given to his disposition, and it was natural
that he should be, at least tentatively, a heretic. These moral
bruises are worse than any or all physical injuries; the man who
has felt them can never be again what he was before. And now
Anselm and William and Fulbert and everybody that he had
bullied or taunted or threatened turned upon him. The gates to
the black cavern of the winds were open and the blasts of fate were
icy cold.</p>
<p>The papal legate Conan held a council at Soissons in 1121.
The opinions of Abelard were received with disfavor. They
humiliated the poor wretch among them and made him burn his
own book, and then mumble through a <i>credo</i> amid his &ldquo;sobs and
sighs and tears.&rdquo; These words are his own, and his is also the
statement that he was put into the custody of the Abbot of St.
Medard and there he was lectured, and even lashed by the convent
whip, until he exhibited proper submission. Poetical justice
had befallen him. For he confesses, to his shame, that he had
coerced and even struck Heloise. Now he, too, was coerced, and
he, too, was struck.</p>
<p>Then back again to St. Denis, with more hatred and hard
speeches than ever. But Suger, the new abbot, an easy-going
lover of bric-&agrave;-brac and good living, set him free, a &ldquo;masterless
man&rdquo; past forty years of age, with Heloise out of reach and the
spears of exultant enemies bristling in every hedge. Is it a wonder
that he took to the banks of the Ardusson near Troyes, wattled
himself a rude hut and resolved to be a hermit? But even there
in the desert the people thronged him and built a village of huts
about his own. His misfortunes became a portion of his strength.
And there they erected for him a church and a cloister which he
dedicated to the Paraclete, a daring innovation, since it was then
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
considered highly heterodox thus to distinguish one person of the
Trinity from the other two.</p>
<p>Under such storms and heat the nature of the man had been
seriously warped. He became suspicious, gloomy, and weakly
unstable. His correspondence with Heloise had been completely
broken off. He went into the monotonous Champagne, then out
into the bleak Brittany, and finally (1125) he received the abbacy
of St. Gildas. His friends, perhaps, desired to save him from
homelessness and so from the dangers which the relentless malice
of his old enemies was constantly piling up. But their choice of
a refuge reveals how little their ecclesiastical influence was worth.
The monks of St. Gildas lived in open sin, and the people around
the cloister were semi-barbarians. It may be that they were ready
to welcome Abelard because they supposed he would be charitable
to their peccadilloes, but if they fancied this, their mistake was
great. He really measured himself against their vices and suffered
a predestined defeat. At St. Gildas he touched the nadir of his
fate as at Paris he had reached its zenith. The monks conspired
against him. They sought to poison him, contaminating with
their drugs even the cup of the Eucharist. When his life was
not fear it was horror, and when it was not horror it was despair.</p>
<p>At this time, too, for calamity never comes singly, Suger had
succeeded in routing from Argenteuil the Abbess Heloise with all
her nuns. He had complained to Rome that the lands of Argenteuil
were the chartered right of St. Denis and that the nuns were
very scandalous. So Abelard roused himself sufficiently to hand
the deserted abbey of the Paraclete over to his wife; to confirm it
by every possible act and deed against invasion; and to secure, in
the despite of Bernard of Clairvaux, who was his presumptive
enemy, a special bull of Innocent II. to make all this permanent.
To these walls Heloise therefore removed. They were
doubly dear to her for Abelard&rsquo;s sake. She had no true &ldquo;vocation&rdquo;
for her office, but the Pope called her and her sisterhood his
&ldquo;dear daughters,&rdquo; and it was the best that they could do.
Abelard prepared their forms of service for them, and thus again,
after all these years, communication existed and letters passed between them.</p>
<p>These forms brought on a controversy with Bernard, who did
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
not like them. The letters also are still extant, often translated,
but never in anything except the original Latin, speaking out the
real nature of the writers. On the part of Heloise they reveal the
depth of an unending love. On the part of Abelard they are as
cold and occasionally as cruel as anything to which a translator
can turn his pen. After a careful survey of their contents the
conclusion is irresistible that Heloise is a woman whose lofty love
carries with it unhesitatingly the mind, the will, the senses&mdash;everything.
Her faults are the faults of her time and of her teaching,
not of her soul. But, by the survival of its most forcible elements,
Abelard&rsquo;s character has been developed into a selfish coldness both
unnatural and ungrateful. As a man, at this stage of his career,
one abhors and pities him.</p>
<p>Presently upon the dead colorlessness of this &ldquo;burned-out crater
healed with snow,&rdquo; the red light of a new controversy is cast. In
this final struggle the redoubtable force of the splendid debater
flashed up once more. But he was defeated by Bernard at Sens
(1140), and whether this defeat was by fair logic or by the hostile
spirit of the age it does not matter. Defeated he was, and he
rushed out declaring that he would appeal to Rome. Happily his
way led him through Cluny, and there good, large-hearted, and
large-bodied Peter the Venerable took him in. For the first time,
perhaps, in all his life he came into close relations with a man
genuinely great. And Peter of Cluny himself wrote to the Pope;
detaining Abelard meanwhile by kind assiduities, in that genial
cloister whose humanity cherished neither bigotry nor license.
Later he even reconciled the two disputants, and the broken and
weary debater died at last (April 21st, 1142) at St. Marcel,
whither he had been sent for change of climate by the care of his
hospitable friend.</p>
<p>There is a painting&mdash;a true artist&rsquo;s conception, but a mere daub
in fact&mdash;which hangs in a New York village and which represents
a dead knight stretched upon the ground. He lies upon his back
on the sodden earth in the melting snow. The sky above him is
of a dull and awful gray, and the carrion birds are flying in a
long, hurrying line to join those already at the feast. A broken
sword is strained in his right hand, his armor is hacked and darkly
spotted with mire and blood, and his feet have fallen into a little
stream. So would have fallen Abelard but for the charity and
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
mercy of Peter the Venerable. Remembering all that he had
been it is somewhat comforting to read of his last days. For certain
letters passed between Peter of Cluny and Heloise, and these,
too, are extant and accessible.</p>
<p>The abbot says to her, after describing the daily life of Abelard,
&ldquo;How holily, how devoutly, in what a catholic spirit he made
confession, first of his faith and then of his sins! ... Thus
Master Peter finished his days, and he who for his knowledge was
famed throughout the world, in the discipleship of Him who said,
&lsquo;Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,&rsquo; persevered,
in meekness and humility, and, as we may believe, passed to the
Lord.&rdquo; It is in such language that this benevolent man addresses
his &ldquo;venerable and very dear sister,&rdquo; concerning, as he tenderly
puts it, her &ldquo;first husband in the Lord.&rdquo; And doubtless this
same Abelard became, at the last, a little child, who through much
tribulation had unlearned his haughty and selfish temper, and had
gone back from subtleties and logic to say in all simplicity,
Abba, Father! And it is not less interesting for us to discover
in the second epistle of Heloise to Peter of Cluny, that
the mother&rsquo;s heart yearns over her boy, and that she commends
Astrolabe to the care and protection of his father&rsquo;s benefactor,
a trust which, in his next letter, Peter accepts and promises to
discharge.</p>
<p>Of the poetry of Abelard much has unquestionably been lost.
His troubadour ballads may have been conveniently suppressed;
it is often the fate of wise men&rsquo;s lighter productions. And his
hymns were for long years untraced, except in the instance of the
<i>Mittit ad virginem</i> and of another upon the Trinity, which was
ascribed to him, but is now accredited to Hildebert. A very
pretty poem, <i>Ornarunt terram germina</i>, preserved by Du Meril
(<i>Poesies Populaires Lat.</i>, p. 444) is given in the collection of
Archbishop Trench and again in that of Professor March. Even
in English its grace and daintiness do not entirely escape us, and
they show how possible it was for him to have written the love-songs
which celebrated Heloise.</p>

<p>At length the adage of Buddha was fulfilled that &ldquo;Hatred does
not cease by hatred; hatred ceaseth by love.&rdquo; This is an old
rule. For in 1836 his romantic story secured an editor for the
scholar&rsquo;s works in the person of Monsieur Victor Cousin, who at
that date, and again in 1849, republished them. They had been
issued in 1616 by Francis d&rsquo;Amboise at Paris, and the city of his
fame and sorrow appropriately witnessed their reappearance. But
even then there were no more verses, and the editors of the twelfth
volume of the <i>Histoire Litteraire de la France</i> also regarded those
productions as hopelessly lost. Yet they had been in Paris, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
when the <i>Patrologia</i> of Migne reached &ldquo;Tom. 178&rdquo; they had
been actually recovered. The story is of the same pattern as the
author&rsquo;s life&mdash;the man and his works had infinite vicissitudes.</p>
<p>When Belgium was occupied by the French, these ninety-three
hymns, written for the abbey of the Paraclete between 1125 and
1134, were lying hid in <i>codice quincunciali</i>, whatever this may
mean. The account seems to require a <i>box</i> of about five inches
in height, rather than an ordinary <i>codex</i> or bound volume. This
<i>codex</i> was brought to Paris and there remained during the days of
Napoleon Bonaparte. When his Empire fell, the box and its contents
returned to Belgium. They bore the seals of the Republic
and of the Empire and they also had the stamp of the Royal
Library of Brussels. They were indeed a catalogued part of that
library&rsquo;s treasures, but their value was unguessed. One day, after
their return, a German student named Oehler, while rummaging
through the <i>codex</i> found in it the <i>libellus</i>, or little book, which
contained these three series of hymns. Like the &ldquo;hymnarium&rdquo;
of Hilary they were known to have been in existence, and hence
he immediately inferred their authorship. They embraced, to his
delight, a complete collection for all the religious hours and for
the principal festivals of the Church.</p>
<p>It is strikingly characteristic of the superficial nature of many
studies in Latin hymnology, that Oehler apparently thought of
nothing else that might be in the <i>codex</i>, but proceeded at once to
publish eight of the recovered hymns. These, attracting the
notice of Monsieur Cousin, he purchased a full transcript of the
<i>libellus</i> at a &ldquo;fair price&rdquo; from the discoverer. It was, however,
reserved for &Eacute;mile Gachet, a Belgian, to &ldquo;give a not unlucky day
to paleography&rdquo; in the course of which he lighted upon this same
<i>codex</i> and found it still to contain the larger part of an epistle
treating of Latin hymnology, addressed to Heloise, and announcing
the hymns of which it was the preface. Thus the identification was perfect,
and the introductions and the hymns are again joined with the other works
of their authors. In 1838 a set of <i>Planctus</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Lamentations&rdquo;&mdash;had
been found in the Vatican Library.
They are moderate in merit, and these new pieces were therefore
invaluable in determining Abelard&rsquo;s rank as a poet. In the main,
his hymns are didactic and cold. But there is at least one which
has held its place anonymously in the service of the Church and
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
upon this his reputation may safely rest. It was translated by Dr.
Neale from the imperfect text of a Toledo breviary, and it can be
found in <i>Hymns, Ancient and Modern</i> (No. 343), and in Mone
(<i>Lat. Hym. des Mittelalters</i>, I., 382). In the Paraclete Breviary
it is &ldquo;xxviii., <i>Ad Vesperas</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rhythm of the Trinity, previously mentioned, is so good
that it is usually, and, it may be, correctly, ascribed to Hildebert
of Lavardin; and the <i>Planctus Varii</i> have really something more
than that &ldquo;inconsiderable merit&rdquo; which Archbishop Trench allows
to them. They are irregular in form and metre, and their subjects
(which evidently reflect their author&rsquo;s feelings) are: The
Wail of Dinah; Jacob&rsquo;s Lament over Joseph and Benjamin; The
Sorrow of the Virgins over Jephthah&rsquo;s Daughter; The Israelites&rsquo;
Dirge over Samson; The Grief of David over Abner and his
Elegy upon Saul and Jonathan. Abelard also composed a long
poem to Astrolabe, giving him plenty of good counsel in fair
pentameter, but in rather prosaic phrases. Some of it sounds like
Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s worldly wisdom, and there are portions of the
production which are plainly affected by the soured and saddened
spirit of the author. &ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; he tells the poor,
forsaken lad, &ldquo;better than a good woman, and nothing worse
than a bad one,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;as in all species of rapacious birds,&rdquo; the
female is the most to be dreaded!</p>
<p>Thus the poems which we possess number one hundred and two
all told. But for ordinary readers not more than five&mdash;if we exclude
the present correct Latin form of the <i>O quanta qualia</i>&mdash;are
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
available in the original, and these are scattered through three or
four collections. An unkind fate has still pursued these poor
relics of the man who took shelter under the broad wing of Peter
the Venerable, and who, by having escaped into such sanctuary,
has barred out from thenceforth all uncharitable thoughts. It
may be added that of Heloise also we have a reputed hymn,
<i>Requiescat a labore</i>, but K&ouml;nigsfeld and Daniel both deny the
authorship. In this they are doubtless correct.</p>
<p>We may best remember the great controversialist when he is
lying dead in his new-found peace and childlikeness. At the request
of Heloise, Peter of Cluny delivered up his body to be
buried within the walls of the Paraclete, in defiance of any misconstruction
or of any sneer. He accompanied the act with the absolution
which she asked. It reads thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Peter, Abbot of Cluny, who received Peter Abelard as a
Cluniac monk, and who have granted his body to be delivered
secretly [<i>furtim delatum</i>, wrote the big-hearted bishop] to Heloise,
the abbess, and to the nuns of the Paraclete, by the authority of
the Omnipotent God and of all saints, do absolve him in virtue of
my office from all his sins.&rdquo; This was to have been engraved
upon a metal plate and fastened above the tomb of the dead rhetorician,
but for some reason&mdash;perhaps connected with the <i>furtim
delatum</i>&mdash;the plan was never carried out. But the absolution was
probably attached to the tomb for a short time in order to make it
effective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; says Mrs. Browning, &ldquo;are knights-errant to the
last.&rdquo; For a score of years, Heloise went each evening to that
tomb to weep and pray. She remembered and observed nothing
of those unpleasant traits which later times have noticed. If she
ever cursed any one it must have been Fulbert, or others of the
dead man&rsquo;s enemies, and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A curse from the depths of womanhood</p>
<p class="t">Is very salt and bitter and good.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At length, like every watching and every waiting, this, too, came
to an end, and she died on May 17th, 1164, precisely at his age
of sixty-three years. And they laid her beside him in the same
grave, as was meet and right.</p>
<p>But evil fate still flapped a raven wing above the pair. Even in
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
death they have scarcely rested in peace. In 1497 the tomb was
opened from religious motives and the bodies were removed and
placed in separate vaults. In 1630 the Abbess Marie de Rochefoucauld
placed them in the chapel of the Trinity. In 1792 they
were again removed to Nogent, near Paris. In 1800, by order of
Lucien Bonaparte, they were transferred to the garden of the
&ldquo;Mus&eacute;e des Monumens Fran&ccedil;ais.&rdquo; This being destroyed in
1815, they were again entombed in P&egrave;re-la-Chaise. M. Lenoir,
keeper of the Museum, had constructed the present Gothic sepulchre
out of the ruins of the abbey of the Paraclete, uniting with these
an ancient tomb from St. Marcel in which Abelard had at first
been laid. Pugin says that this was transferred from the Mus&eacute;e
grounds. The monument reared at the Paraclete and ornamented
with a figure of the Trinity, perished in 1794 during the confusion
of the Revolution. General Pajol, the subsequent owner of the
grounds, placed a marble pillar above the stone sarcophagus which
yet existed, but the lead coffin had already been taken to Paris.
The tomb in P&egrave;re-la-Chaise has been recently repaired, and there
the sentimental of all nations have brought flowers and scrawled
names and scribbled verses. Even at the present day a curious
collection of wire crosses, immortelles, and visiting-cards can be
seen constantly upon it.</p>
<p>The principal inscription was composed by the Academie des
Inscriptions in 1766, at the instance of Marie de Roucy de
Rochefoucauld, Abbess of the Paraclete, like her namesake of
1497; and it was carved at her cost upon the stone.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. The story of Abelard and Heloise has a literature
of its own. We have no authentic portraits, if we except the
fine pictures of Robert L&eacute;f&egrave;bvre engraved by Desnoyers, which
rest upon I know not what of possible likeness. But the Englishman,
Berington; the Germans, Brucker and Carriere and Fessler
and Schlosser and Feuerbach; the Frenchmen, De R&eacute;musat and
Cousin and Guizot and Delepierre and Lamartine and Dom Gervaise;
the Italian, T&ograve;sti; the Americans, W. W. Newton, Wight,
and Abby Sage Richardson, and a host of other authors and
essayists and reviewers, have in one form or another told the
sad, sweet legend of this love. It has never lacked its audience,
and its perpetual charm has been the character of Heloise.
Like the fair and unfortunate maid of Astolat, who so pathetically
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
loved Launcelot, it may be said of her devotion that
she &ldquo;gave such attendance upon him, there was never a woman
did more kindlyer for man than shee did.&rdquo; It was a rare exhibition
of that precious jewel, an unselfish, loyal, and flawless
heart!</p>

<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">PETER THE VENERABLE.</span></h2>
<p>It serves to illustrate the meshes which held the highest men of
the twelfth century together, when we encounter Peter the Venerable,
Abbot of Cluny. His true name was Pierre Maurice de
Montboisier and he was from Auvergne&mdash;&ldquo;one of the noblest and
most genial natures,&rdquo; says Morison, &ldquo;to be met with in this or
in any time.&rdquo; What a fine old man he was! Under him as
abbot, Bernard of Cluny was prior, and the loving care of Peter
prepared an epitaph for that bravest and sweetest of singers. It
was he who bearded the other Bernard in his very den, and who
came out of many contests against that almost invincible ecclesiast
with more honor than before. Few could say this of a battle with
the Abbot of Clairvaux; and to no one but Peter does Morison,
the biographer of Bernard, concede any such victory.</p>
<p>It was also this admirable Peter who took Peter Abelard under
his protection. With a large and patient generosity he developed
the better nature of that headstrong, conceited, unhappy man;
and when Abelard died he wrote to Heloise the really warmhearted
and tender letter, with a great deal of humanity about it,
which I have quoted already. And thus, to whomsoever it may
fall to consider the history of France in the twelfth century; or of
Abelard and the new philosophy; or of Bernard and ecclesiastical
polity; or of the other Bernard and the Latin hymns, it is inevitable
that the name of Peter the Venerable shall arise and stand
high above the throng of those by which he is surrounded.</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s name was Raingarde, and her death, long after he
had attained his wide reputation, was deeply felt by him as that of
one of the best of women and dearest of mothers. For Pierre de
Montboisier, in those days when the stagnation and corruption of
thought and morals were not felt as they were felt later on, was a
man as well as a monk. But when, at last, the religious people
became monks and not men; when they were stupid, uninteresting,
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
fat-fleshed and gross in life; when they had no courage or
piety; then they neither did the world any good nor made their
own souls ripe for heaven. And as sportsmen tell us that the
mellow &ldquo;bob-o-link&rdquo; ceases to sing and is only fit for slaughter
when he becomes the &ldquo;rice bird&rdquo; of the South, so it was with
them. Latin hymnology almost ceases to be interesting after this
century. And Peter the Venerable, while he wrote but little himself,
is too fine a factor in the arousing of others for us to forget
him and his work.</p>
<p>He must have been born in 1092 or 1094&mdash;the earlier date being
more probable; and when he was sixteen or seventeen (1109) he
became a monk of Cluny. These were the &ldquo;black&rdquo; monks;&mdash;as
the Cistercians of Citeaux and Clairvaux were the &ldquo;white.&rdquo;
He had six brothers, most of whom took similar vows. What else
indeed was there to do? You must either hack and hew your
way with a battle-axe, and risk your neck and your castle, or you
must become a monk. There was no middle course. Peace-loving,
studious people&mdash;those who aimed to help the world up
toward God&mdash;had no other choice. Nowadays we should find
plenty of room for Peter; but he did what was then best, and
entered Cluny.</p>
<p>At thirty years of age he was its abbot. This was in 1122. It
happened by reason of Pontius, the former abbot, a self-sufficient
and imperious man, being forced to resign his office and go on
pilgrimage to Palestine; he even promised not to come back at
all. Then the monks of Cluny elected another abbot; and as
he died almost immediately, they were compelled to choose a
third, namely Peter. But it was in a hard seat that they placed
him; he had a mismanaged property, and a body of men who
needed a good deal of attention.</p>
<p>Let us picture him to us in the fashion and habit of his appearance.
He had a &ldquo;happy face,&rdquo; a &ldquo;majestic figure,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;plenty of those other unfailing signs of virtues&rdquo; which justified
his name &ldquo;The Venerable.&rdquo; It was such a big-hearted, big-bodied
style of man who now undertook this reformation. By
the help of Matthew, Prior of St. Martin in the Fields, near
Paris, he effected it in about three months. Then there was a
period of peace. But, all of a sudden, here comes Pontius, with
soldiers at his heels, when Peter is absent, wanting his old place
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
again. He bursts in the gates, forces the monks who remain to
swear allegiance, carries off crosses and candlesticks and whatever
was worth anything for melting down into money, and plays
robber-baron over all the neighborhood. Peter himself tells the
story: &ldquo;He came in my absence.... With a motley crowd
of soldiers and women rushing in together, he marched into the
cloisters. He turned his hand to the sacred things.... He
raided the villages and castles around the abbey, and, trying to
subdue the religious places in a barbaric way, he wasted with fire
and sword all that he could.&rdquo; It was certainly a very serious
matter.</p>
<p>Peter did the best he could with it&mdash;this resulting in Honorius
II. despatching a legate from Rome with a great curse, ready-baked
and smoking-hot, for the soul&rsquo;s benefit of that &ldquo;sacrilegious,
schismatic, and excommunicate usurper,&rdquo; Pontius. I have not
read the curse; but I am positively certain that Pontius and Pontius
Pilate must have been elaborately compared in its sentences.
Such anathemas were supposed to dry the blood and wither the
brain. Pontius trembled and restored his ill gotten gains and
vanished to his own place. And Peter had peace at last.</p>
<p>There had already been a controversy with St. Bernard about
Robert, Bernard&rsquo;s cousin, who liked the cordiality of Cluny a
good deal better than the thin-visaged and almost fierce zeal of
Clairvaux. For this reason he changed his allegiance. Consequently
Bernard wanted him sent home. And by this time he
was, according to strict rule, actually restored. However, Clairvaux
chuckled very much at the confusion in Cluny; and Bernard
was ungenerous enough to take this time, of all others, to
publish quite an elaborate and even brilliant disparagement of the
Cluniac rule. I shall let this also pass for the present, for it will
meet us again, only saying that Peter seems to have gone on wisely
about his own business and avoided any reply&mdash;a quite unusual
proceeding in a controversial age. In 1126 he had taken up
again his previous line of administration; and when this &ldquo;apology&rdquo;
came out in 1127 he was practically meeting its objections in the
best manner. As Frederick Maurice says of him, &ldquo;The Abbot
of Cluny would have wished the monk to be rather an example
to men of the world of what they might become, than the type of
a kind of life which was in opposition to theirs. He feared that a
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
grievously stringent rule would lead ultimately to a terrible laxity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1130 Pope Honorius died. Pierre de Leon (Peter Leonis),
calling himself Anacletus, got himself illegally elected, and seized
the control at Rome. Cardinal Gregory of San Angelo, who was
the rightful but weaker claimant, assumed the title of Innocent
II., and forthwith set out to secure the help of the great abbeys of
France. Now Anacletus had been a Cluniac; and Bernard,
Peter&rsquo;s and Cluny&rsquo;s opponent, favored Innocent. But when
Innocent, in 1132, appeared at Cluny, he was hailed as the true
and genuine Pope&mdash;a piece of magnanimity which he had no right
to expect.</p>
<p>And from this time Peter&rsquo;s allegiance was undoubted; although,
like a great many persons in the world, Innocent II. conceded
more to the stern will of Bernard than to the generous conduct of
the Abbot of Cluny. Indeed, he did but very little in the way
of privilege for Peter&rsquo;s abbey; and he turned nearly all his gifts
and favors toward Bernard. This so exalted the Cistercians that
Peter protested. It is a blot upon Innocent that such a protest
was needed. For Peter had been the first to welcome him, sending
him &ldquo;sixty horses and mules, with everything which could be
wanted by a pope in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many a man would have wheeled around and left the ingrate.
But Peter&rsquo;s revenge was handsome and characteristic. He summoned
a general chapter of his order; and it was held at the time
that Innocent, recognized at length, was going away to Rome.
There were &ldquo;two hundred priors and a thousand ecclesiasts,&rdquo;
delegates from France, England, Spain, Germany, and Italy.
These cheerfully and promptly agreed to accept a more stringent
rule in all their religious houses. And thus Innocent, and his
Warwick of a Bernard, could see for themselves the strength and
the charity, and the sincere purpose of the man whom they were
setting aside. I feel that I must here add the exact words in
which Morison, St. Bernard&rsquo;s best biographer, justifies this estimate
of the character of Peter the Venerable. &ldquo;The relations
between Peter and Bernard throughout their lives,&rdquo; he says
(p. 222, <i>note</i>), &ldquo;give rise to contrasts little favorable to the latter.
Peter nearly always is gentle, conciliating, and careful not to give
offence, even when as here (in the case of the Bishop of Langres)
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
sorely provoked. Bernard too often made return by hard and
even violent language and conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such a stately and well-balanced person in our mind&rsquo;s eye,
we cannot be surprised to find that he had plenty of solid pluck,
that he was &ldquo;mild as he was game, and game as he was mild.&rdquo;
In 1134, returning from the Council of Pisa against Anacletus, he
and his followers were attacked by robbers. The abbot tucked
up his sleeves, and took the sword of the Church militant on the
spot. Perhaps he was glad to let his big thews and sinews have
full play. At all events he so dashed and smote these ungodly
men, that he beat them actually back, and had therefrom considerable
glory. I never read that he or his abbey was much meddled
with afterward.</p>
<p>About this date his visits to Spain drew his attention to the
Koran. He was struck by the religious efficiency of it, and in
order to meet it better he prepared for a full translation of it.
Peter of Toledo, Hermann of Dalmatia, and an Englishman named
Robert Kennet, or perhaps (says the <i>Histoire Litteraire</i>) de Retines,
were selected for this duty. To them were added an Arab scholar
and Peter of Poitiers, the abbot&rsquo;s favorite private secretary. They
were to render the Koran into Latin directly; and at it they went,
accomplishing their task between 1141 and 1144, at the time of
an epidemic in the monastery. Then Peter himself joined with
them in a refutation of its errors&mdash;albeit his Latinity was not first-rate,
being rather that of a man of affairs than of a student. There
was another Latin refutation of the Koran by Brother Richard, a
Dominican who lived in the thirteenth and into the fourteenth
century. Luther translated that into German in 1542.</p>
<p>What a warm-blooded, good, hearty fellow Peter must have
been! He had only found three hundred monks at Cluny in
1122; but Hugo of Cluny, his successor, was entitled to take
rule, there and elsewhere, over ten thousand. Mount Tabor, the
Valley of Jehoshaphat, and Constantinople were among the places
where the &ldquo;black&rdquo; monks were well established. And a large
share of this was due to the sagacity and statesmanship of Peter.
In proof of this fine humanity, take his behavior to Abelard. The
full story comes properly in another place; for Abelard himself
was a writer of hymns, and worthy of more than transient reference.
But when poor Abelard was repudiated, disgraced, shamefully
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
mutilated, and nearly at despair&rsquo;s edge, wearied out with St.
Gildas and his refractory monks, and finally defeated by the purer
and higher logic of Bernard, then, indeed, do we see Peter of
Cluny at his best. He received the disappointed and broken
man with &ldquo;the welcome of an unutterably guileless and sympathetic
heart.&rdquo; Cluny&rsquo;s gates opened wide to take him in.
Cluny&rsquo;s genial, restful spirit closed in about his own like the
feathers of the mother bird around her callow, shivering brood.</p>
<p>And when he dies, it is Cluny&rsquo;s abbot who details with the
loving particularity, which would most help the sore heart of
Heloise, all his last doings. He speaks even to the kinship of
every age when, after this long and tender letter, whose Latin
glows with a deep fervency, he closes in this wise: &ldquo;May God,
in your stead, comfort him in his bosom; comfort him as another
you; and guard him till through grace he is restored to you at the
coming of the Lord, with the shout of the archangel and the
trump of God descending from the heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is time that we speak of his writings, of which a full edition
was published at Paris in 1522, one of the Cluniac monks being
its compiler. Frequently, during the next two hundred years,
they are republished in whole or in part. They are thus by no
means inaccessible, though their merit is not so great. One of
the important works is directed against the Jews, for whom he had
a most pious dislike. Others are in the nature of epistles or
of controversial replies, valuable only for their time and their
spirit.</p>
<p>Of his verse, however, we have left us but about fourteen specimens.
One of these is against the detractors of the poetry of
Peter of Poitiers, who were nearer right than he supposed them
to be. Another is a rhymed epistle to a certain Raimond, of
some sixty-four lines. Then we have a &ldquo;prose,&rdquo; the word being
cognate to <i>prosody</i>, in honor of Jesus Christ. Its structure, except
for the additional short syllable, is identical with the &ldquo;leonine
and tailed rhyme&rdquo; of Bernard of Morlaix, his prior:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A patre mittitur, in terris nascitur, Deus de virgine</p>
<p class="t0">Humana patitur, docet et moritur, libens pro homine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It celebrates Him, sent from the Father, born on the earth,
God from a virgin, wearing our mortal shape, teaching and tarrying
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
with us, and atoning for our sins. The best, perhaps, of all
his poems is what Trench and March quote:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mortis portis fractis, fortis</p>
<p class="t0">Fortior vim sustulit,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>the real original of those splendid lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now broken are the bars of Death,</p>
<p class="t0">And crushed thy sting, Despair!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>which we find in Bishop Heber&rsquo;s resurrection hymn, commencing,
&ldquo;God is gone up with a merry noise.&rdquo; There is a life to these
verses which one must understand their author in order to appreciate.
They follow, in the best attire that I can give them. They
are exultant rather than illustrious. It is the man and not his
measures whom we celebrate! Daniel does not think it worth his
while to include him at all. Archbishop Trench takes his own
text from the <i>Bibliotheca Cluniacense</i>, Paris, 1614:</p>
<h3>ON THE RESURRECTION OF OUR LORD.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The gates of death are broken through,</p>
<p class="t">The strength of hell is tamed,</p>
<p class="t0">And by the holy cross anew</p>
<p class="t">Its cruel king is shamed.</p>
<p class="t0">A clearer light has spread its ray</p>
<p class="t">Across the land of gloom</p>
<p class="t0">When he who made the primal day</p>
<p class="t">Restores it from the tomb.</p>
<p class="t0">For so the true Creator died</p>
<p class="t">That sinners might not die,</p>
<p class="t0">And so he has been crucified</p>
<p class="t">That we might rise on high.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For Satan then was beaten back</p>
<p class="t">Where he, our Victor stood;</p>
<p class="t0">And that to him was deathly black</p>

<p class="t0">Thus calmly and with mighty thought</p>

</div>
<p>Peter the Venerable died on December 25th, 1156; but how
or with what surroundings we are not told. He was buried beside
his old comrade, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, within the
walls of the church which Innocent II. consecrated upon his
memorable visit to Cluny. And the <i>Histoire Litteraire</i> breaks
out into an unusual eulogy; and declares that in his case the title
of &ldquo;Venerable&rdquo; was no less honorable than that of &ldquo;Saint.&rdquo;
They did not make &ldquo;saints&rdquo; out of such men as Peter&mdash;and I
don&rsquo;t quite see why they should. There was too much flesh-and-blood
reality about him, too little of musty theology and altogether
too little bigotry. But somehow the broad-faced happy sun
proves himself to be the &ldquo;greater light;&rdquo; while the moon goes
palely on, a ghost in an unaccustomed sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">BERNARD OF CLUNY.</span></h2>
<p>In the twelfth century&mdash;the time of the great Crusades&mdash;we find
the noblest and purest of Latin hymns. It is the age of Hildebert,
Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter of Cluny, and Adam
of St. Victor. But among them all I find no one who has inspired
a deeper and more lovely desire for the heavenly land than Bernard
of Cluny.</p>
<p>The information about him is very meagre. He was born at
Morlaix in Brittany, of English parents. He seems to have
attained to no ecclesiastical dignity&mdash;such men seldom care for
baubles and trinkets. But his is as true a soul as ever burned
like a star on a summer night, against the warm, obscure, palpitating
heaven of eternal hope. The date of his prominence is fixed
by the fact that Peter the Venerable was his abbot, and it is therefore
included between 1122 and 1156. I have (in <i>The Heavenly
Land</i>) myself assigned the <i>Laus Patriae Coelestis</i>&mdash;his famous and
only poem, which is addressed to Abbot Peter, to 1145 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>His single up-gush of melody is a lamentation over the evil
condition of the times in which he lives. They were indeed days
to sadden the soul of the saint; and he called his poem <i>De Contemptu
Mundi</i>; for he despised the <i>immundus mundus</i>&mdash;the foul
world in which he was forced to remain. It consists of some
three thousand lines of dactylic hexameter, and was first published
(so says Trench, who is its step-parent) by Matthias Flacius
Illyricus in his scarce and little known supplement to the <i>Catalogus
Testium Veritatis</i>. In this &ldquo;Catalogue of Witnesses to the Truth&rdquo;
he gathers all those who have testified against the papacy, and
the supplement, <i>Varia doctorum piorumque Virorum de Corrupto
Ecclesiae Statu Poemata</i> (1556), is made up of hymns and poems
in which the pious <i>within</i> the Church, as well as without her walls,
sorrowed over her corruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Bernard&rsquo;s poem is sometimes known, therefore, by his own title,
<i>De Contemptu Mundi</i>, and sometimes by that given by Trench to
his cento of about one hundred lines, <i>Laus Patriae Coelestis</i>, the
&ldquo;Praise of the Heavenly Land.&rdquo; From this cento one would
derive altogether an erroneous idea of the whole; but Dr. Neale,
who wrote with the full text before him, although he paraphrased
but part of it, tells us that the poem, in great part, is a bitter
satire on the fearful wickedness of the times. It was the part
Trench passed by for which Matthias Flacius Illyricus, its first editor,
cared the most. The sins and greediness of the Court of Rome
are the theme of the eighty-five lines he has embodied in the text
of the <i>Catalogus</i> itself. By both that and the poems of his supplement,
he sought to justify the Protestant Reformation on the side
of Christian discipline and morals.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>The translators have had a hard problem in Bernard&rsquo;s poem,
and but few have attempted to &ldquo;bend the bow of Ulysses.&rdquo; Dr.
Neale has achieved the most popular and useful result, in the version
from which &ldquo;Jerusalem the Golden&rdquo; has been extracted, but
he does not pretend to literalness. &ldquo;My own translation,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;is so free as to be little more than an imitation.&rdquo; Dr.
Coles has gone straight away from the dactyls and made a version
in anapests&mdash;a metre which does not do justice to Bernard. Archbishop
Trench has rendered a few lines in the same measure as
the original. I have myself followed (in 1867) the exact metre
and rhyme of the original poem; but such a version is rather
curious than useful. The translation signed by &ldquo;O. A. M.,
Cherry Valley,&rdquo; is in its typography, while fine and clear, affectedly
antique. The metrical power of this version is inferior. It is
dactylic but not fluent, and does not at all represent the original.
That by Mr. Gerard Moultrie is praised by Dr. Trench as metrically
close and poetically beautiful. I have no hesitation in saying
it is the best version which has appeared in English. It seems to
keep both to the spirit and the letter of the original, and is in all
respects a remarkable achievement. It, however, omits the double
rhyme, and thus avoids the chief difficulty of a reproduction of the
form of the original. That by Rev. Jackson Mason (1880) will
not stand a comparison with Mr. Moultrie&rsquo;s, as it halts and breaks
in its measure and produces an effect on the ear far from pleasant.</p>
<p>The difficulty of translation is due entirely to the character of
the verse. Bernard himself declares &ldquo;unless that spirit of wisdom
and understanding had been with me, and flowed in upon so difficult
a metre, I could not have composed so long a work.&rdquo; Not
that this form of verse was original with him. Peter Damiani has
used it in one of his hymns to our Lord&rsquo;s mother:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O miseratrix, O dominatrix, praecipe dictu</p>
<p class="t0">Ne devastemur, ne lapidemur, grandinis ictu.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And, to go farther back still, a certain Theodulus, who lived in
the reign of the Emperor Zeno (474-91) wrote a poem of nine
hundred lines on Bernard&rsquo;s own theme, <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i>, in
the same metre:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Pauper amabalis et venerabilis est benedictus</p>
<p class="t0">Dives inutilis insatiabilis, est maledictus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p class="t0">Qui bona negligit et mala diligit intrat abyssum;</p>
<p class="t0">Nulla pecunia, nulla potentia liberat ipsum.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A glance will show the nature of this trouble which the patient
Bernard encountered. Take the two lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hora <i>nov&iacute;ssima</i>, tempora <i>p&eacute;ssima</i> sunt, <i>vigil&eacute;mus!</i></p>
<p class="t0">Ecce <i>minaciter</i>, imminet <i>&aacute;rbiter</i>, ille <i>supr&eacute;mus</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>That is:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">He, first in <i>l&aacute;wfulness</i>,</p>

</div>
<p>Of course it is infinitely harder to the translator who is restricted,
than to the composer who can eddy around his subject&mdash;led by
the rhyme as much and as freely as he will. And this is what
Bernard always does. His verses are ejaculations, desires, lamentations,
longings&mdash;measured out by the &ldquo;leonine hexameter&rdquo;
which he employs. To show the beauty still untranslated, as well
as to exhibit more of the structure of the poem, I append four of
these lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Pax ibi florida, pascua vivida, viva medulla,</p>
<p class="t0">Nulla molestia, nulla tragoedia, lacryma nulla.</p>
<p class="t0">O sacra potio, sacra refectio, pax animarum</p>
<p class="t0">O pius, O bonus, O placidus sonus, hymnus earum.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus Englished, closely:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Peace is there flourishing,</p>
<p class="t0">Pasture-land nourishing,</p>
<p class="t">Fruitful forever.</p>
<p class="t0">There is no aching breast,</p>
<p class="t0">There is no breaking rest,</p>
<p class="t">Tears are seen never.</p>
<p class="t0">O sacred draught of bliss!</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, like a waft of bliss!</p>
<p class="t">Sustenance holy!</p>
<p class="t0">O dear and best of sounds,</p>
<p class="t0">Heard in the rest of sounds,</p>
<p class="t">Hymned by the lowly!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Or thus, less closely and more according to the spirit of the poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Peace doth abide in thee;</p>
<p class="t0">None hath denied to thee</p>
<p class="t">Fruitage undying.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou hast no weariness;</p>
<p class="t0">Naught of uncheeriness</p>
<p class="t">Moves thee to sighing.</p>
<p class="t0">Draught of the stream of life,</p>
<p class="t0">Joy of the dream of life,</p>
<p class="t">Peace of the spirit!</p>
<p class="t0">Sacred and holy hymns,</p>
<p class="t0">Placid and lowly hymns,</p>
<p class="t">Thou dost inherit!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So strange and subtle is the charm of this marvellous poem,
with its abrupt and startling rhythm, that it affects me even yet,
though I have but swept my fingers lightly over a single chord.
I seem to myself to have again taken into my hand the old familiar
harp, whose strings I have often struck in times of darkness or of
depression of soul, and to be tuning it once more to the heavenly
harmony which the old monk tried to catch. Perhaps some day,
when the clouds are removed, I shall see him, and understand
even better than now the glory that lit his lonely cell, and made
him feel that</p>

<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">ADAM OF ST. VICTOR.</span></h2>
<p>The school of St. Victor, in Paris, was founded by William of
Champeaux, the teacher and rival of Abelard, at the commencement
of the twelfth century. It is known to history as having
been the abode of three distinguished scholars, Hugo, Richard,
and Adam. Hugo and Richard of St. Victor were mystics, and
Vaughan, in <i>Hours with the Mystics</i>, has set them before us.
From this and other sources, we grow more and more amazed to
find the immense influence of such a school. A century from its
foundation showed St. Victor to be the parent of thirty abbeys and
of more than eighty priories. Here in these cells, like bees in a
hive, the busy monks were laying up the only honey of the Dark
Ages&mdash;multiplying manuscripts, delving into remote philosophies,
muddling their brains over abstruse questions, but now and then
leaving behind them something to benefit mankind. Theology
and dialectics were their great and indeed their only pursuits.
Like the swirls of a sluggish stream beneath its banks, they occasionally
caught and kept fresh some broken flower from the shore.
Thus, one may, for example&rsquo;s sake, put a certain pretty idea of
Hugo of St. Victor into modern verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hugo, St. Victor&rsquo;s prior&mdash;a man</p>
<p class="t">Gentle and sweet, contemplative and wise,</p>
<p class="t0">Makes mention in his fine and mystic plan</p>
<p class="t">Of three great steps by which our spirits rise:</p>
<p class="t">First, <i>Cogitation</i>&mdash;when we turned our eyes;</p>
<p class="t0">Then, <i>Meditation</i>&mdash;when our minds began</p>
<p class="t0">With hovering wing the kindled thought to scan;</p>
<p class="t">Last, <i>Contemplation</i>&mdash;which all doubt defies.</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, and he saith that, in the greenest wood</p>
<p class="t">Of stubborn souls, this glory kindleth so</p>
<p class="t">That the pure flame against the sap will glow</p>
<p class="t0">And be by nothing finally withstood&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">The smoke itself be parted to and fro,</p>
<p class="t0">Until clear light shall shine in constant good.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Richard was the disciple and successor of this gentle-spirited
Hugo. In 1114 the priory became an abbacy, and when Richard
was prior in 1162, he had for abbot no very godly person, since
under Ervisius all discipline was relaxed, and scandal and sensuality
began to rule. But Richard stood out stoutly and with
good judgment; and he lived to see the old harmony and glory
return again. In his day and in that of Adam, which was contemporaneous
with his, the school represented the dialectical and
theologic, rather than the spiritual and mystical side of religion;
and yet it did good work, as a peacemaker, for the truth. It gives
us little enough, however, with which to fall in love. Massive it
may be, and intricate in its curious ability respecting useless pieces
of chop-logic, but the profound piety which belongs to every age
and clime did not find much to comfort it at St. Victor. These
men dug shafts and tunnels, they did not open foundations and
sink wells down to living streams.</p>
<p>Adam of St. Victor, as I have said, lived in those days, and they
produced their natural effect upon his mind and upon his writings.
He died somewhere between 1172 and 1192; and while
he was celebrated as the expositor of St. Jerome&rsquo;s prefaces to the
books of the Bible, and was known as the composer of &ldquo;sequences,
rhythms, and other writings,&rdquo; his fame rests upon his modern rediscovery
by Monsieur Gautier. The history of the preservation
of his hymns is itself a suggestive commentary on the difficulties
of Latin hymnology, and so I give it entire.</p>
<p>Clichtove, a Flemish theologian of the period between 1500
and 1550, undertook to help his brethren to comprehend the
offices of the Church. His <i>Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum</i> was first
published in Paris in 1515, and then at Basle in 1517 and 1519.
There were four subsequent editions&mdash;that of Paris (1556) being
the best, and that of Cologne (1732) being the latest. Now this
book was the great mine for Latin hymns before Daniel, Trench,
Mone, K&ouml;nigsfeld, March, and others made them accessible.
And of Adam of St. Victor he gives thirty-six specimens, which
were supposed to be all that had remained, with one or two possible
exceptions.</p>
<p>In 1855 J. P. Migne published in his <i>Patrologiae Cursus</i>, in
volume 196, these thirty-six hymns of Adam of St. Victor. Archbishop
Trench, who is such an admirer of our poet, has doubtless
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
been indebted to the many helpful Latin notes, with which the
excellent editor of the <i>Patrologia</i> has enriched the obscurity of his
author. At least so it seems to a person who compares Trench&rsquo;s
own notes with that Latin.</p>
<p>Monsieur Gautier, however, determined to look further, the result
being that he published the <i>Oeuvres Poetiques d&rsquo; Adam de St.
Victor</i> in 1858 at Paris. This gives us one hundred and six
hymns&mdash;of which Trench says that some of them were well known
but anonymous; and others are strictly new, and fully equal to
his best compositions. From this source, then, the two great
admirers of Adam of St. Victor&mdash;Archbishop Trench and Dr.
Neale&mdash;have drawn their originals.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that theologians should enjoy such a poet as
Adam. He is so terse, so dialectically subtle, so metaphysically
accurate, so allegorically copious. In a line he often makes a
reference which his editor struggles to catch in a foot-note a page
long. And you must comprehend the reference in order to comprehend
the poem! As I read the eulogy of Trench, I find him
saying that when we remember Adam of St. Victor&rsquo;s theologic
lore, his frequent and admirable use of Scripture, his art and
variety in versification, his &ldquo;skill in conducting a story,&rdquo; and his
own personal feeling which permeates his poems, we must put him
&ldquo;foremost among the sacred Latin poets of the Middle Ages.&rdquo;
Dr. Neale, too, calls him &ldquo;the greatest of mediaeval poets.&rdquo; And
so, &ldquo;what shall he do that cometh after the King?&rdquo; For, in
spite of this mighty commendation, and in spite of the praise
which these didactic hymns have obtained, <i>we cannot and do not
sing any of them</i>. Even Dr. Neale cannot make them singable,
though he would probably do it if he could.</p>
<p>I must confess&mdash;and take the risk of being charged with stupidity
and ignorance&mdash;that I cannot place Adam of St. Victor where they
have set him. Southey&rsquo;s ballads and poems are legion, as we
know, and they are learned beyond all cavilling; but they will not
live like the two or three little things of Motherwell. And Adam&rsquo;s
vast congeries of sequences, composed for all the saints and festivals
of the calendar, cannot stand an instant against the sweetness of
Bernard of Clairvaux, or the grandeur of Peter Damiani&rsquo;s judgment
hymn. These others, it is true, wrote less, but they wrote
<i>subjectively</i>, and hence they appealed to the heart of the Christian
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
in every age. For <i>verse</i> alone, however skilful, is not <i>poetry</i>; and
the celebration of saints and angels, however beautifully accomplished,
ministers nothing to &ldquo;a mind diseased.&rdquo; We need to
feel a genius which kindles its watch-fire in the line of signal&mdash;as
did Helena&rsquo;s watchers between Jerusalem and Constantinople.
Then, as this flame flares up into the night, we know that it
speaks to us of the discovery of the true cross.</p>
<p>I am thus compelled to dissent from the <i>cultus</i> which has grown
up about this brilliant, epigrammatic, and altogether admirable
Adam. For he attracts by his obscurity and he surprises by his
intricacy; and the interest excited is that of the scholar and of the
translator, rather than that of the popular approval of the Christians
of to-day. And I am glad to support this opinion, not
merely by the rather caustic comment of Professor March, but by
the word of Mrs. Charles, where she speaks of &ldquo;his elaborate
system of Scriptural types occasionally chilling the genuine fire of
his verse into a catalogue of images.&rdquo; And I must add, for my
own justification, that this &ldquo;fire&rdquo; is the fire of the orator, and not
altogether that of the poet. It is objective and not subjective;
for though there be two kinds of poetry in the world, we cannot
doubt which kind it is that &ldquo;permanently pleases and takes commonly
with all classes of men&rdquo;&mdash;for this was Aristotle&rsquo;s unequalled
definition.</p>
<p>It is time that we should take a glance at this laureate of St.
Victor, whose monumental plate of copper remained, down to the
date of the first Revolution, near the door of the choir in that
ancient cloister. The epitaph upon it was mainly drawn from his
own work. It breathes the same contempt of earth and derision
of its vanities, which we find so common in that age.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>&ldquo;Vana salus hominis, vanus decor, omnia vana;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Inter vana nihil vanius est homine.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Vain is the welfare of man and his fashion, for all things are vanity;</p>
<p class="t0">And, in the midst of vanity, nothing is vainer than man.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was a later hand than his own which, after selecting those ten
lines from Adam&rsquo;s own writings, added four very inferior verses to
complete the inscription. These state that:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I who lie here, the unfortunate and wretched (<i>miser et miserabilis</i>)
Adam, ask one prayer as my highest reward: I have sinned; I confess;
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
I seek pardon; spare the contrite. Spare me, father; spare me, brethren;
spare me, God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was born in Brittany, to the best of our information. He
studied in Paris, and finally entered the walls of St. Victor, never
to leave it. It is a very brief record, but it illustrates the monotony
and dead sameness of that mediaeval monastic life. The
Dark Ages were mud-flats, from which the tide had gone out.
And yet I think that Adam of St. Victor had another side to him,
which Trench and Neale might well have developed&mdash;a power of
livelier rhythm than is often suspected. The little stranded fish
perchance gambolled a trifle in its small sea-water pool.</p>
<p>The poem which I quote is found in Migne and Gautier. It
differs from another sequence upon a similar theme&mdash;one which
Dr. Neale has translated. It is &ldquo;The Praise of the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This poem, it will be seen, is abrupt, irregular, and altogether
inferior, in some features, to the usually finished and elegant diction
of its author. For this very reason I have selected it; it exhibits
Adam of St. Victor when he dashes off the stanzas without
revision, fired by the glow of his theme. Only on this account
do I render it, trying merely to carry its dash and spirit into the
English version.</p>

</div>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s peculiarities are very marked in this production. He
alludes, as you perceive, to the Cross in the air which Constantine
took as his sign in which to conquer. He refers to Chosroes,
King of Persia, who, after great successes and the conquest of Jerusalem
itself, was finally overcome by Heraclius, the Eastern Emperor,
about 622-29 <span class="small">A.D.</span>; and he also drags in a piece of mystical
imagery about the &ldquo;four-squareness&rdquo; of the earth, which is
hard enough to understand without a key. The key is one with
many wards. It includes the &ldquo;breadth, depth, length, and
height&rdquo; of the love of Christ; it suggests the appearance of the
heavenly city of John&rsquo;s vision; it reminds us of the temple in
Ezekiel&rsquo;s prophecy, and of the account of the actual structure in
1 Kings; it recalls the classical geographers&rsquo; notions about the
shape of the earth and about the &ldquo;four quarters,&rdquo; which we still
call east, west, north, south; it finally symbolizes all these things
by the four arms of the Cross! Is it any wonder that Adam of
St. Victor is a difficult poet to translate, and that his verses are not
fitted to be sung?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Yet it must not be forgotten that the <i>Heri mundus exultavit</i> (St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Day) and the <i>Veni, Creator Spiritus, Spiritus Recreator</i>,
are both his. Nor must it escape notice that Dr. Neale&rsquo;s <i>Mediaeval
Hymns</i> contains eleven versions of Adam of St. Victor; while
Dr. Washburn, Chancellor Benedict, and other translators have
quite made the old schoolman&rsquo;s &ldquo;sequences&rdquo; and &ldquo;proses&rdquo;
familiar to the most careless eye. Recently also we have the three
volumes of Mr. Digby S. Wrangham (London, 1881) in which
our poet is translated entire, the Latin and English being placed
upon opposite pages. He has attained such an eminence as
Drummond of Hawthornden, who has come back to us because
he knew Ben Jonson and had kept and stratified the spirit of his age.</p>
<p>To me the man is always fascinating, always suggestive. He
appears to challenge the best that we moderns can do. His very
terseness is a defiance. And here, in this strange symmetry, I
fancy that I see the alertness and skill of that wise insect which
takes hold with her hands in kings&rsquo; palaces. The web of this
precise and unvarying artisan often sparkles with the morning dew
of a pure devotion. The lines and stays and braces and fashioning
of these illustrious verses are as accurate as the spider&rsquo;s spinning.
I look up toward the light and, yonder, upon some Corinthian
capital of the song of songs&mdash;or over there in a corner of the
gate called Beautiful through which Ezekiel walks&mdash;or again, high
amid the wisdom of that Solomon&rsquo;s Porch of the Apocalypse
where stands the serene John&mdash;there I see how Adam of St. Victor
has stretched his web. And if, now and then, some dead fly of
an obscure allusion, or some desiccated bit of monasticism, offends
the sight, I strive to think only of the art that has spread the fabric&mdash;and
God&rsquo;s glorious sunshine brightens, upon His own temple,
His little creature&rsquo;s toil!</p>

<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">THOMAS OF CELANO.</span></h2>
<p>Hymnologists have their favorites among the sacred singers of
the Middle Ages, but all concede the first place to the poet who
gave the world the <i>Dies Irae</i>, the great sequence or &ldquo;prose&rdquo; sung
in the service for the dead of the Latin Church. It has attracted
more attention than any other single hymn. Whole books have
been written about it. It is indissolubly associated in the history
of music with Mozart&rsquo;s wonderful &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo; and in that of
literature with the concluding scenes of the first part of &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;
More translations have been made of it than of any other poem in
the Latin language, or perhaps in any language. All Christendom
rejoices in it as a common treasure, the gift of God through a
devout Italian monk of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>It was in an age full of vitality that this &ldquo;hymn of the giants&rdquo;
was written&mdash;the most interesting century in the history of Christendom,
Matthew Arnold says. In all directions we encounter
the play or collision of great forces. The Papacy, the Empire,
the Crusades, the Mendicant Orders, and even, in its way, the
Inquisition, give evidence of the working of a spirit of energy and
movement, which places the century in sharp contrast to the less
explicit development which had preceded, and the age of comparative
exhaustion which followed. Nowhere was this more visible
than in the characters of the great Churchmen of the thirteenth
century. Popes like Innocent III. and Gregory IX., founders of
orders like Dominic and Francis, theologians like Aquinas and
Bonaventura, may excite our admiration or our censure, but they
are men of such magnitude as are not to be found in other centuries
in the same number. They were live men, and they have
made a lasting impression upon the world by the force of their
vitality.</p>
<p>Two of these, Aquinas and Bonaventura, we shall meet again
as hymn-writers. But first we have to deal with one whose chief
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
claim to recollection is a single great hymn. Thomas of Celano
was an Italian at a time when Italy was stirred by the great battle
of Pope with Emperor into an intellectual life, which was to culminate
in Dante at the close of the century. Exactly in its last
year the writing of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> was to begin. The
troubles of his time must have come very close to Thomas. His
native city of Celano, a town of the old Marsians, was one of the
first to suffer under the hand of Frederick II. In 1223 it was
forced to capitulate by the Count of Acerra, Thomas of Aquinas,
the warlike uncle and namesake of the great theologian. The
inhabitants were compelled to leave their houses, taking all their
movables, and the place was burned to the ground, only the
church of St John being left standing among the ruins. The
people, to punish their disloyalty to the Emperor, were transported
to Sicily, Malta, and Calabria, whence they returned to rebuild
their town after their enemy&rsquo;s death. How old Thomas was at
the time of this calamity, and whether it had anything to do with
his becoming a monk of the Order of Francis of Assisi, we do not
know. But certainly it is not impossible that the spectacle of this
<i>dies irae</i>, when the sanctities of his boyhood&rsquo;s home were left
desolate, or even the news of its occurrence in his absence, may
have left a permanent impression upon his mind, and may have
suggested more or less directly his great hymn.</p>
<p>Celano lay in the northern end of the Kingdom of Naples, as it
was afterward called, across the Apennines from Rome and slightly
north of it. It was not far from the northern boundary of Frederick&rsquo;s
hereditary dominions, across which lay the Umbrian region,
where Assisi is situated. At some time and in some way Thomas
made his way to Assisi, and came under the influence of the
wonderful man whose personality has made the mountain town a
place of pilgrimage even for those who are not of the Latin communion.</p>
<p>Francis of Assisi is one of the strangest, if also one of the most
beautiful figures in the history of Christendom. Protestants vie
with Catholics, Karl Hase and Margaret Oliphant with Frederic
Ozanam and Joseph Goerres, in depicting this devout and childlike
spirit, who took poverty for his bride and set himself to realize
in the utmost literalness the command to go forth to preach repentance
and forgiveness of sins, taking neither scrip nor purse,
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
and possessing no more than the absolute necessaries of human
existence. At first he had no thought of founding an order, but
only of helping the poor and the suffering for Christ&rsquo;s sweet sake.
But the divine fire of loving humility and childlike simplicity in
the man drew others inevitably to his side, until there arose in his
mind the sense of a great vocation to gather men into a new form
of brotherhood. &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; he said to his earliest disciples,
&ldquo;in that ye seem few and simple-minded. Preach repentance to
the world, trusting in Him who hath overcome the world, that
His Spirit speaks through you. You will find some to receive
you and your word with joy, if still more to resist and mock you.
Bear all that with patience and meekness. Take no heed for your
simplicity or mine. In a short time the wise and the noble will
come to preach with you before princes and people, and many
will be turned to the Lord. He has shown it to me, and in mine
ears there is a sound of the multitude of disciples who are to
come to us out of every people. The French are on the way; the
Spaniards are hurrying; the Germans and English run; and a
multitude of other tongues hasten hither.&rdquo; So Thomas of Celano
records his words in his biography of the saint, which is the freest
from exaggerations and the most trustworthy of them all.</p>
<p>As Thomas survived Francis some thirty years, there is no
reason to regard him as one of the group of the first disciples who
began to gather around the founder as early as 1209. He is not
named among &ldquo;the twelve apostles&rdquo; who came first. But the relation
between the two men seems to have been more than usually
close and intimate. Perhaps it was the more so as being founded
on contrasts rather than on resemblances in their characters. For
Francis was distinguished from other teachers of his age by the
bright and cheerful views he entertained of God and His love to
mankind. This was the theme of his sayings and his songs; this
he preached to the poor when they streamed out of the Italian
cities to welcome him as one who brought comfort and joy to the
downcast. They emphasized their sense of the difference between
him and the ordinary preachers by saying, &ldquo;He hears those whom
even God will not hear!&rdquo; Thomas, on the other hand, seems to
have been constitutionally predisposed to look at the darker side
of things, to sing of judgment rather than of mercy. But he, too,
found comfort in the heart-sunshine of his master. &ldquo;His words
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
were like fire,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;penetrating the heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;How lovely,
splendid, glorious he appeared in innocence of life, in simplicity
of speech, in purity of heart, in divine delight, in brotherly love,
in constant obedience, in loving harmony, in angelic aspect.&rdquo;
He found in Francis the most perfect realization of the Christian
ideal that he or his century could conceive of; and shall we not
admit with George Macdonald that a perfect monk is a very fine
thing in his way, although much less so than a perfect man?</p>
<p>Their sympathies as poets must have drawn them together.
Francis, as Joseph Goerres well says, was a troubadour as well as
a saint. In his youth he had won distinction as a singer of
worldly songs in the proven&ccedil;al French, which was then the language
of literature in Northern Italy. After his conversion he
burst out singing the praises of God in this same foreign and
exotic tongue. But as he became more directly interested in the
welfare of his fellow-men, he began to use his gift of song in his
native Italian. How many of the poems that are printed under
his name are really his own, and how many are the work of his
disciple, Jacopone da Todi, is matter of dispute. But even Father
Affo (1777), the most negative of critics on this point, does not
deny his authorship of the wonderful &ldquo;Song of the Sun,&rdquo; also
called the &ldquo;Song of the Creatures,&rdquo; in which the childlike delight
of the saint in God&rsquo;s works finds such charming expression, that
Matthew Arnold has singled it out as the utterance of what is most
exquisite in the spirit of his century. Thomas, too, it was known,
had the poetic gift, and indeed was recognized by his brethren as
the man of most literary power in the order. Upon him they laid
the duty of compiling the founder&rsquo;s biography, and of writing the
&ldquo;legend&rdquo; of his life, which should be read in the breviary service
on the day of his commemoration.</p>
<p>Yet he also was recognized as possessing practical gifts. The
order had spread into Germany as well as in the other directions
of which Francis had prophesied. The first attempts to establish
it north of the Alps, made in 1216, were not happy. The Italians
sent on this mission knew only one German word, &ldquo;Ja!&rdquo; &ldquo;Are
you heretics?&rdquo; (<i>Sind Sie Ketzer?</i>) was the first question put to
them on Teutonic soil; and knowing nothing else to say, they
said &ldquo;Ja!&rdquo; So they were marched across the frontier again in
disgrace. But brethren better provided in the matter of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
Ollendorff had been sent five years later, and now Thomas of Celano
was one of those who had been selected for the German mission, to
give stability and unity to the work there. He was made &ldquo;custos&rdquo;
of the monasteries at Mainz, Worms and Koeln (Cologne), and
even took charge of the whole province when its head returned
to Assisi. We find Thomas himself back in Assisi by 1230,
where Jordan, the &ldquo;custos&rdquo; of the Thuringian monasteries, came
to see him.</p>
<p>Francis had died in 1226, but whether Thomas was actual
witness of his last days, or derived his knowledge of them from
others, his is recognized as the authentic account of the saint&rsquo;s
departure. His own death is said to have occurred in 1255, but
what events filled up the meantime, besides the biographic labors
we have mentioned, is not known. Perhaps it was in those years
that he composed his great sequence, as his mind, when less
directly brightened by the influence of his master, would be more
likely to revert to those trains of thought which corresponded to
his natural disposition. Possibly it was as his own life was drawing
to a close, and the shadows of the Great Day gathered nearer
him, that he poured out his soul in his great hymn&mdash;the greatest
of all hymns, unless we except the <i>Te Deum</i>.</p>
<p>Besides the <i>Dies Irae</i>, there are ascribed to Thomas two other
sequences&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Fregit victor virtualis</i></p>
<div class="verse">
<p>and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Sanctitatis nova signa</i>,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>both in commemoration of Francis. As the founder of the Minor
Friars was canonized two years after his death by Gregory IX.,
there was a demand very early for the hymns of this character.
And as there was no one better fitted to write them than the poet
who had known Francis so well, and whom the Pope had directed
to prepare a life of the saint, there is no inherent improbability in
the tradition which ascribes them to him. But they do not take
rank beside the <i>Dies Irae</i>. They are poems written to order, not
the spontaneous outpouring of the mind of the singer in the presence
of the overwhelming realities of the spiritual universe.</p>
<p>There are no less than nine persons for whom the honor of the
authorship of the <i>Dies Irae</i> has been claimed. Two of these are
excluded as having lived too early to have written a poem of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
structure and metrical character; they are Gregory the Great and
Bernard of Clairvaux. Two others, Augustinus Bugellensis (ob.
1490) and Felix Hammerlein (ob. 1457) are excluded by the fact
that the hymn is mentioned in a work written in 1285. This
leaves four rivals to Thomas of Celano in his own century, viz.,
John Bonaventura (ob. 1274), his brother Cardinal, Latino Frangipani,
a Dominican (ob. 1294), Humbert, a French Franciscan,
who became the fifth general of his order (ob. 1277), and Matthew
of Acqua-Sparta in Umbria, a Franciscan, who became Bishop
of Albano and cardinal (ob. 1302). But it is to be noticed that
for not one of these is there a witness earlier than the sixteenth
century. The first and last are named as having had the authorship
ascribed to them by Luke Wadding, the historian of the
Franciscans in 1625; but he ascribes it to Thomas of Celano.
The other two are named by the Jesuit, Antonio Possevino (1534-1611)
and the Dominican, Leandro Alberti (1479-1552), the latter,
of course, claiming the hymn for the Dominican cardinal, as to
whom there is not the smallest evidence that he ever wrote any
poetry whatever. Besides this, the <i>Dies Irae</i> is a Franciscan, not
a Dominican poem. It deals with the practical and the devotional,
not the doctrinal elements in religion. Had a Dominican
written it, he would have been anxious only for correct doctrinal
statement.</p>
<p>Thomas&rsquo;s claim to its authorship does not rest on the weakness
of rival pretensions. In the year 1285, when Thomas had been
dead about thirty years and Dante was twenty years old, the Franciscan
Bartholomew of Pisa wrote his <i>Liber Conformitatum</i>, in
which he drew a labored parallel between the life of Francis of
Assisi and that of our Lord. Having occasion to speak of Celano
in this work, he goes on to describe it as &ldquo;the place whence came
Brother Thomas, who by order of the Pope wrote in polished
speech the first legend of St. Francis, and is said to have composed
the prose which is sung in the Mass for the Dead: <i>Dies irae, dies
illa</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>
This testimony out of Thomas&rsquo;s own century is confirmed
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
by parallel evidence. Wadding, whose big folios in clumsy Latin
give us the tradition which prevailed within the order, says:
&ldquo;Brother Thomas of Celano sang that once celebrated sequence,
<i>Sanctitatis nova signa</i>, which now has gone out of use, whose work
also is that solemn one for the dead, <i>Dies irae, dies illa</i>, although
others wish to ascribe it to Brother Matthew of Acqua-Sparta, a
cardinal taken from among the Minorites.&rdquo; Elsewhere Wadding
says: &ldquo;Thomas of Celano, of the province of Penna, a disciple and
companion of St. Francis, published ... a book about the <i>Life
and Miracles of St. Francis</i> ... commonly called by the brethren
the <i>Old Legend</i>. Another shorter legend he had published
previously which used to be read in the choir...; three
sequences, or rhythmic proses, of which the first, in praise of St.
Francis, begins, <i>Fregit victor virtualis</i>. The second begins,
<i>Sanctitatis nova signa</i>. The third concerning the dead, adopted
by the Church, <i>Dies irae, dies illa</i>. And this Benedict Gonon, the
Coelestine [in 1625] rendered into French verse and ascribed to
St. Bonaventura. Others ascribe it to Brother Matthew, of Acqua-Sparta,
the cardinal; and others yet to other authors.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>These direct testimonies are confirmed by local tradition in the
province of Abruzzi, in which Celano is situated, and the Franciscan
origin of the hymn by its existence as an inscription on a
marble tablet in the church of St. Francis at Mantua, where it was
seen by David Chytraeus, a German Lutheran, who visited Italy
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
in 1565. That the author was an Italian is indicated by the
peculiar three-line stanza, which approximates to the <i>terza-rima</i>
structure of their poetry, but is not found in poetry of the Northern
nations, except in later imitations.</p>
<p>The statement of Bartholomew of Pisa, that already in 1285 the
<i>Dies Irae</i> was employed in the service for the dead, shows how
early it made its way into church use. In earlier times there was
no sequence in that service, for the reason that the &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo;
which the sequence always followed, being a song of rejoicing,
was not sung in the funeral service. This enables us to form an
opinion on the controversy as to whether it was written directly for
church use, or adapted for that after being written as a meditation
on the Day of Judgment for private edification. It would seem
most probable that it was the wonderful beauty and power of the
hymn which led the Church to break through its rule as to the
sequence following a Hallelujah necessarily. The <i>Dies Irae</i> was
not written to fill a place, but when written it made a place for
itself.</p>
<p>This controversy connects itself with another as to the genuineness
of certain verses which are prefixed or added to the eighteen
of the text in the Missal. There are, in fact, three texts of the
hymn: (1) That of the Missal, which is generally followed, and
will be found at the end of this chapter. (2) That of the Mantuan
marble tablet, which prefixes four verses:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1. Cogita, anima fidelis,</p>
<p class="t0">Ad quid respondere velis</p>
<p class="t0">Christo venture de coelis.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">2. Cum deposcit rationem</p>
<p class="t0">Ob boni omissionem,</p>
<p class="t0">Ob mali commissionem.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">3. Dies illa, dies irae,</p>
<p class="t0">Quam conemur praevenire</p>
<p class="t0">Obviamque Deo ire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">4. Seria contritione,</p>
<p class="t0">Gratiae apprehensione,</p>
<p class="t0">Vitae emendatione.</p>
</div>
<p>After these come in the Mantuan text the first sixteen verses of
the Missal text, with slight and unimportant variations, but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
seventeenth and eighteenth are omitted, and the following conclusion
substituted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">17. Consors ut beatitatis</p>
<p class="t0">Vivam cum justificatis,</p>
<p class="t0">In aevum aeternitatis. Amen.</p>
</div>
<p>(3) The Hammerlein text, so called because found among
the manuscripts of Felix Hammerlein after his death, which
occurred about 1457. This also contains the first sixteen verses
of the Missal text, but with far more variations than the Mantuan
text shows, although not such as commend themselves by their
merits. Then it proceeds, altering and expanding the seventeenth
and eighteenth into three and adding five more:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">17. Oro supplex a ruinis,</p>
<p class="t0">Cor contritum quasi cinis;</p>
<p class="t0">Gere curam mei finis.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">18. Lacrymosa die illa,</p>

<p class="t0">Tanquam ignis ex scintilla,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">19. Judicandus homo reus,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Hinc ergo parce Deus,</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">20. Quando coeli sunt movendi,</p>

<p class="t0">Nullum tempus poenitendi.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">21. Sed salvatis laeta dies;</p>
<p class="t0">Et damnatis nulla quies,</p>
<p class="t0">Sed daemonum effigies.</p>

<div class="verse">

</div>

<p>That neither of these additions at the beginning and end are
parts of the original sequence, will be evident to any one who
feels the terseness and power of the original. They are feeble,
lumbering excrescences, and are fastened to it in such an external
way as to destroy the unity of the poem, if left as they stand.
The text in the Missal gives us a new conception of the powers of
the Latin tongue. Its wonderful wedding of sense to sound&mdash;the
<i>u</i> assonance in the second stanza, the <i>o</i> assonance in the third, and
the <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> assonances in the fourth, for instance&mdash;the sense of
organ music that runs through the hymn, even unaccompanied, as
distinctly as through the opening verses of Lowell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vision of
Sir Launfal,&rdquo; and the transitions as clearly marked in sound as
in meaning from lofty adoration to pathetic entreaty, impart a
grandeur and dignity to the <i>Dies Irae</i> which are unique in this
kind of writing. Then the wonderful adaptation of the triple-rhyme
to the theme&mdash;like blow following blow of hammer upon
anvil, as Daniel says&mdash;impresses every reader. But to all this the
supplementary verses add nothing.</p>
<p>Of the use of the hymn in literature I have spoken already. Sir
Walter Scott introduces a vigorous and characteristic version of a
portion into his &ldquo;Lay of the Last Minstrel&rdquo; (1805). Lockhart,
writing of the great Wizard&rsquo;s death-bed, says of his unconscious
and wandering utterances: &ldquo;Whatever we could follow him in
was some fragment of the Bible, or some petition of the Litany,
or a verse of some psalm in the old Scotch metrical version, or
some of the magnificent hymns of the Romish ritual. We very
often heard distinctly the cadence of the <i>Dies Irae</i>.&rdquo; So the Earl
of Roscommon, in the previous century, died repeating his own
version of the seventeenth stanza:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Prostrate, my contrite heart I rend;</p>
<p class="t0">My God, my Father, and my Friend,</p>
<p class="t0">Do not forsake me in my end!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Samuel Johnson never could repeat the tenth stanza without
being moved to tears&mdash;the stanza Dean Stanley quotes in his
description of Jacob&rsquo;s Well. Goethe makes Gretchen in &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
faint with dismay and horror as she hears it sung in the cathedral,
and from that moment of salutary pain she becomes another
woman. Meinhold in his &ldquo;Amber-Witch&rdquo; (<i>Die Bernsteinhexe</i>),
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
represents the very same verses as bringing comfort and assurance
to a more stainless heroine in the hour of her sorest distress.
Carlyle shows us the Romanticist tragedian Werner quoting the
eighth stanza in his strange &ldquo;last testament,&rdquo; as his reason for
having written neither a defence nor an accusation of his life:
&ldquo;With trembling I reflect that I myself shall first learn in its
whole terrific compass what I properly was, when these lines shall
be read by men; that is to say, in a point of time which for me
will be no time; in a condition in which all experience will for
me be too late:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Rex tremendae majestatis,</p>
<p class="t0">Qui salvandos salvas gratis,</p>
<p class="t0">Salva me, fons pietatis!!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Justus Kerner, in his <i><a href="#c39">Wahnsinnige Br&uuml;der</a></i>,
depicts the overwhelming power of the hymn upon minds hardened by long
continuance in sin, but suddenly awakened to reflection by its thunders
of the Day of Reckoning. Daniel well compares it to the picture
of the Day of Judgment, which was the means of converting the
King of the Bulgars to Christianity.</p>
<p>The translations of our hymn into modern languages, especially
into German and English, have been numbered by the hundred.
Partly no doubt this is due to the entirely Evangelical type of its
doctrine, its freedom from Mariolatry, its exaltation of divine
mercy above human merit, and its picture of the soul&rsquo;s free access
to God without the intervention of Church and priest. Lisco
(1840 and 1843) was able to specify eighty-seven German versions.
Michael (1866) brought this number up to ninety, of which sixty-two
are both complete and exact; and Dr. Philip Schaff says he
can increase the list beyond a hundred without exhausting the
number. Among the German translators are Andreas Gryphius
(1650), A. W. Schlegel (1802), J. G. Fichte (1813), A. L.
Follen (1819), J. F. von Meyer (1824), Claus Harms (1828), J.
Emmanuel Veith (1829), C. J. C. Bunsen (1833), H. A. Daniel
(1839), F. G. Lisco (1840), besides partial versions by J. G. von
Herder (1802) and J. H. von Wessenberg (1820).</p>
<p>The translations into English begin with one by Joshua Sylvester
in 1621, that of Richard Crashaw in 1646 coming second. There
are four of that century and two of the next, the most notable
being the Earl of Roscommon&rsquo;s in 1717. In the first thirty years
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
of the nineteenth century there are but four, the notable being the
partial version by Sir Walter Scott in 1805, and Macaulay&rsquo;s in
1826. Since Isaac Williams published his in 1831, there has
been a steady succession of versions, bringing the number for the
United Kingdom in this century up to fifty-one. Of these the
most noteworthy are by John Chandler (1837), Henry Alford
(1844), Richard C. Trench (1844), William J. Irons (1848),
Edward Caswall (1849), Frederick G. Lee (1851), John Mason
Neale (1851), William Bright (1858), Elizabeth R. Charles
(1858), Herbert Kynaston (1862), Richard H. Hutton (1868),
Dean Stanley (1868), William C. Dix (1871), and Hamilton
McGill (1876).</p>
<p>In point of numbers at least America surpasses England and
approaches Germany. Since 1841, when two anonymous versions
appeared in this country, there have been at least ninety-six complete
versions by American translators, bringing the total of enumerated
versions in the language up to one hundred and fifty-four. Of
American translators may be named William R. Williams (1843),
H. H. Brownell (1847), Abraham Coles (1847 and later), William
G. Dix (1852), S. Dryden Phelps (1855), John A. Dix (1863
and 1875), Marshall H. Bright (1866), Edward Slosson (1866),
E. C. Benedict (1867), Margaret J. Preston (1868), Philip Schaff
(1868), Samuel W. Duffield (1870 and later), John Anketell
(1873), Charles W. Elliot (1881), Henry C. Lea (1882), M. W.
Stryker (1883), H. L. Hastings (1886), and W. S. McKenzie
(1887). This certainly, both by the length of the list and the
weight of many of the names, constitutes a tribute to the power
of the <i>Dies Irae</i> such as never has been offered to any other
hymn! Only Luther&rsquo;s <i>Ein&rsquo; feste Burg</i>, of which there are eighty-one
versions in English alone, can compare with it.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Of these English versions, those by Rev. W. J. Irons and Dean
Stanley in England, and those of General John A. Dix and Mr.
Edward Slosson in America, have enjoyed the most popularity.
They certainly are excellent, but every translator seems somewhere
to fail of complete success. Nor do those who have returned
again and again to the attempt seem to accomplish their own ideal
of a perfect translation. Dr. Abraham Coles, who has made some
sixteen or seventeen renderings, is no better off than when he
began. Nor do I think my own sixth version has carried me one
inch beyond my first. The truth is that not even the <i>Pange lingua
gloriosi</i>, which Dr. Neale calls the most difficult of poems, is in
this respect the equal of this alluring and baffling hymn. But the
reader, who has had no access to the hymn except through the
poorest version, has the means to discern the fact that in it a great
mind utters itself worthily on one of the greatest of themes.</p>
<p>It happened to me once to enter a crowded church, where presently
a distinguished German divine arose to speak. Others had
addressed the audience in English; but he, turning to his fellow-countrymen,
began to pour forth a trumpet-strain of lofty eloquence
in his native tongue. He spoke of the &ldquo;better valley,&rdquo;
of a happy and peaceful land. He seemed to see its broad and
gentle river and to hear the chiming of its Sabbath bells. He
peopled the air with its lovely citizens and created about us the
presence of its glorious joy. Faintly and brokenly, as now and
then he uttered some familiar words, I could catch glimpses of
that <i>besseres Thal</i>, and its brightness and beauty, and the awe of
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
its holy calmness came upon me&mdash;upon me, the stranger and the
foreigner, in whose speech no word was said.</p>
<p>But they who were of the lip and lineage of the land, they whose
country was brought so near and whose hopes were raised on such
strong and familiar wings&mdash;they truly were moved to the soul. I
saw tears in their eyes; I heard their suppressed and laboring
breath; I beheld their eager faces; and the glory of that land fell
on them even as I gazed. So, though we cannot here perceive the
fulness of the Franciscan&rsquo;s hymn, yet do we discern the stately
splendor of Messiah&rsquo;s throne, and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Catch betimes, with wakeful eyes and clear</p>
<p class="t0">Some radiant vista of the realm before us.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This alone can justify another attempt&mdash;the resultant of four
previous versions&mdash;to express something of the grandeur of this
majestic hymn:</p>

<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THOMAS AQUINAS AND JOHN BONAVENTURA.</span></h2>
<p>In Southern Italy, about midway between Rome and Naples,
the road which connects these two cities passes near the site of the
ancient city of Aquinum. It was a stronghold of the Volscians,
although not mentioned in the account of their wars with the
Romans. As a Roman municipality it rose to greater importance
than the other cities of the district, and became the birthplace of
the satirist Juvenal and other eminent men. But in the seventh
century it was destroyed by the Lombards, and the site never re-occupied.
What were left of its inhabitants found another site,
more capable of defence in those wild days, and built Aquino on a
mountain slope. It runs along the cliff in a single street, like
our own Mauch Chunk, and the remains of its oldest buildings
show that its mediaeval architects drew freely upon still earlier
structures for their materials.</p>
<p>In one of these old structures, still known as the <i>Casa Reale</i> or
royal house, lived the noble family who were the lords of Aquino.
Here Thomas Aquinas was born in the year 1225, being one of
the five children of Count Landulf of Aquino, and his wife, Theodora
Caraccioli, Countess of Teano. The family was not a royal
house, but it was connected by intermarriage with the royal caste
of Europe. It is said, but I have not been able to verify the
statement, that Thomas&rsquo;s grandfather had married a sister of the
Emperor Barbarossa. His mother was descended from the
Tancred of Hauteville, whose sons, Roger and Robert Guiscard,
effected the Norman conquest of the two Sicilies. Sibylla, Queen
of the Tancred who ended the first line of Norman sovereigns, is
said to have been a daughter of the family. But the real importance
of the lords of Aquino was due to their strategic position on
the northern frontier of Apulia and to their military spirit. Richard
of Aquino, the grandfather of Thomas, was the mainstay of
Tancred&rsquo;s cause on the mainland of Italy, and merited, by his
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
treachery and barbarity, the cruel death the Emperor Henry VI.
inflicted on him after the final conquest of the two Sicilies. His
father, Landulf, seems to have been a man of less warlike character;
but his uncle, Thomas of Aquinas, who succeeded Richard in the
countship of Acerra, was the ablest of the Ghibelline chiefs of
Southern Italy, and one of Frederic the Second&rsquo;s most trusted captains.
That emperor enlarged the dominions of the family, and
gave ample scope to their fighting propensities in his wars with
the popes. And Thomas&rsquo;s two brothers, who were older than himself,
embraced the opportunity of a military life. His sisters
formed illustrious alliances with the noble families of Southern
Italy. Pope Honorius III. is said to have been his godfather.</p>
<p>Thomas&rsquo;s youth seems to have been uneventful, with the exception
of the calamity by which he lost a younger sister, who was
killed by lightning while sleeping by his side. In his fifth year
his education began. Less than five miles away, as the bird flies,
lay the Monte Casino, the greatest and first of the monasteries of
the Benedictine order. Here it was that Benedict of Nursia in 529
laid the foundation of the first great order of Western Christendom.
And although Monte Casino had shared in the calamity of Aquino
at the hands of the Lombards, and had lain desolate for a hundred
and fifty years, it had been rebuilt with new splendor, and was at
this time the grandest ecclesiastical establishment outside the city
of Rome. And here, in 1227, Landulf Sinibald, himself of the
Aquino family, had become abbot, thus attaining one of the highest
dignities open to a Churchman. To his care the young
Thomas was intrusted, and on Monte Casino he spent the next
seven years of his life, undergoing the discipline and receiving the
instruction for which the schools of the Benedictine fathers had
always been famous. Probably it was the hope of the family of
Aquino that the young man would enter the order and rise to the
same dignity as his uncle, becoming a prince of the Church, and
thus more powerful and wealthy than any of his uncles or brothers.</p>
<p>In 1239 the second outbreak of hostilities between the Pope and
the Emperor led to the conversion of Monte Casino into a great
fortress, in which were left but eight monks to carry on the routine
of monastic services. The rest found a home in other Benedictine
houses, the schools were suspended, and Thomas returned home.
But the same year he seems to have proceeded to Naples to study
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
in the university which Frederic had established in 1224, and
amply endowed with wealth and privileges, and had revived in 1234,
after its suspension during his first war with the papacy. He had
forbidden his Italian subjects to leave the kingdom to attend foreign
universities, and he had used every available means to make
them contented with that of Naples, one of these being the employment
of the ablest teachers he could secure in all the sciences
then recognized as belonging to the higher education. We are
told that Thomas pursued his studies two years in Naples, when
the influence of his Dominican teachers led him to form the purpose to become a
Dominican friar,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
and to put on the garb of a
novice. This step was a most momentous one. Whether his
family looked forward to his becoming a Benedictine monk and
abbot, or contemplated his embracing the offers of promotion in
the civil service of the kingdom, which Frederic II. had held out
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
to the graduates of his pet university, they could not but regard his
adoption of the life of a mendicant friar with indignation and disgust.
To be a Benedictine <i>Pater</i> was to be a gentleman and a
scholar, to have a share in the influence, wealth, and power of the
order, and possibly to rise to the dignity of the <i>Dux et Princeps
omnium Abbatum et Religiosorum</i>, the Abbot of Monte Casino.
But the Mendicant orders were affairs of yesterday, with all the
rawness if also the effusive enthusiasm of youth. Francis of Assisi
died within a year of Thomas&rsquo;s birth; Dominic, five years earlier.
And the mendicant mode of life was most offensive to the proud
Italian nobles, who must have recoiled from the idea that one of
their race should carry the beggar&rsquo;s wallet in his turn, and live
always upon alms. In this respect the requirements of the
orders were far stricter and more humiliating than in later times,
when the practice, if not the rule, was relaxed. Those who were
unaffected by their enthusiasm thought of the Mendicants as the
average man thinks of the Salvation Army, or thought of the
Methodists at the middle of the last century.</p>
<p>No notice was sent to Aquino of the step Thomas had taken.
The monks always had their share of the wisdom of the serpent,
and they were to show it in this case. But some of the vassals of
the family had recognized the young novice under his Dominican
garb on the streets of Naples or in the church; and through them
the news reached his family. Landulf seems to have been dead;
I can find no mention of him later than 1229. But the Countess
Theodora hastened, with all a man&rsquo;s energy, to rescue her son
from the career of a mendicant. The friars learned of her coming
and hurried their novice off to Rome, and to Rome his mother
pursued him. To avoid her he was sent forward to France, but
he had to pass the lines of the imperial army then engaged in the
war with the Lombards. The influence of the powerful Ghibelline
family roused the vigilance of the imperial authorities. At
Acquapendente, on the frontiers of Tuscany, Thomas and the friars
who escorted him were arrested, and the young noble was sent
back to his family at Aquino.</p>
<p>Every means, foul as well as fair, seems to have been used to
break him from his purpose to join the Dominicans, while he remained
a prisoner at Aquino, or in some of the mountain castles
of the family. But Thomas was assured of his vocation, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
had a fund of obstinacy in his character which showed to good
purpose. It is said that the Pope interfered in his behalf, but
this is hardly probable, as the Pope was waging war at the time on
the Emperor and his vassals, the Lords of Aquino. At last the
countess and her children abandoned the attempt to influence
him, and at least connived at his escape to Naples, where he took
the vows of obedience, celibacy, and poverty, which sealed his
connection with the Dominican order, in 1243.</p>
<p>We have looked at this step through the eyes of his family, and
seen its offensiveness. But if we regard it more impartially, we
are impressed with its wisdom. It was among the Dominicans,
not the Benedictines, that Thomas could serve his day and generation
the best. The Benedictines, in the new age which the era
of the Crusades opened to Europe, had fallen behind the times. It
was because of this that that century saw the rise of the two great
orders founded by Dominic and by Francis, and their rapid growth,
until &ldquo;a handful of corn on the top of the mountains&rdquo; shook like
the forests which clothe Lebanon. The Dominican order was still
in the blossom of youth; the Benedictine had rather &ldquo;gone to
seed.&rdquo; Thomas felt the difference when he met the Dominicans
as professors of theology in the Studium at Naples. Scholarship
rather than thought had been the strong point with the Benedictines.
They would be apt to meet the questions which welled up
in the mind of the eager youth by an inapposite quotation from
some Church father, or to repress them altogether, as tending to
vanity. What, indeed, could Abbot Landulf and his brethren on
the hill-top do with a deep-eyed boy, who went from one to
another with the question, &ldquo;What <i>is</i> God?&rdquo; But at Naples,
and in contact with the more lively intellectual life of his age, his
acute and alert intellect found a satisfaction and an encouragement
which the Benedictines could not give him. He was encouraged
to ask questions instead of being snubbed. There were
opened to him vistas of research and speculation, which could not
but attract a hungry and active mind like his. The Dominicans
were the order which had undertaken to face and answer the questions
of the age, and in Thomas these questions were craving a
solution. What wonder if he fell in love with the preachers, and
they with him! They discovered what capacity lay in the young
noble, and knew that they had better use for him than his hum-drum
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
uncle on the hills and among the hawks. And any scruples
as to his admission to the novitiate without the consent or against
the will of his family were set aside by the belief that his &ldquo;vocation&rdquo;
was directly from God, and therefore set aside all merely
human authority.</p>
<p>Having secured their prize, the Dominicans showed that they
knew how to use it. The order was, on one side of it, a great
educational institution to select and train young men to fight the
intellectual battles of the Church. The young Dominican at once
put on the yoke of the &ldquo;course of study&rdquo; (<i>Ordo Studiorum</i>),
which had been prescribed by the General Chapter, and proceeded
as far toward the highest dignities and responsibilities of learning
as his abilities were thought to warrant. The decision on this
point rested with the General of the Order, who at this time was
John of Germany, the fourth in the succession begun by Dominic.
He selected for Thomas as his best teacher, Albert of Bollstadt,
better known as Albert the Great (Magnus), who was teaching
in the monastic school at Koeln (Cologne), and who had the
reputation of having absorbed all that Aristotle knew, and worked
up his teaching into a harmony of Christian theology with Greek
philosophy. According to his biographers generally, Thomas was
sent at once to Koeln in 1245, and accompanied Albert when he
proceeded to Paris in that same year to take his degree as Doctor
of Theology, returning with him in 1248. Dr. Heinrich Denifle,
however, assigns 1248 as the year when Thomas came to Koeln
from Italy, and limits their intercourse as master and scholar to
the two years required by the rules of the order. Whether their
relations as such extended over five years or were limited to two,
they were enough for the formation of a life-long friendship based
on mutual respect and admiration. Strangely enough the young
Italian from the garrulous South was noted more for silence than
for speech among the students at Koeln. He had found a teacher
whom he thought worth hearing in silence, and he heard to better
purpose than his associates. <i>Bos mutus</i>, a dumb ox, they called
him. Albert foretold that &ldquo;the sound of his bellowing in doctrine
would yet go through the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1250, the year when Frederic II. died, Thomas proceeded
to Paris by direction of the General of the Order. In that mother
university of Christendom the Dominicans were allowed by their
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
rule to receive the doctorate&mdash;in that and no other. For one year
the candidate must hear and dispute in the Dominican school on
St. Jacques Street; for another he must teach, but without ascending
the cathedra, from which authoritative decisions were expected.
But in Thomas&rsquo;s case these two years of his Parisian apprenticeship
were prolonged to seven. The university quarrelled with the
representatives of the Mendicant orders just as Thomas was about
to take his degree, and in the five years&rsquo; struggle which ensued all
ordinary relations and procedures were suspended. For some
time, indeed, the university itself was dissolved, to evade the bull
of excommunication which the Pope aimed at it in the interest of
the Mendicants.</p>
<p>In 1656 William of St. Amour sent the Pope his treatise <i>Concerning
the Dangers of these Last Times</i> (<i>De Periculis Novissimorum
Temporum</i>), in which he pleaded the cause of the university
against the Mendicants, and told some home-truths about the
greediness, the lawlessness, and the encroachments of the friars,
but in an angry and excited tone, which harmed his cause. Both
the assailed orders put forward their ablest men to make answer.
For the Franciscans spoke John Fidanza, better known as John
Bonaventura, who had come to Paris in the heat of the conflict,
and had been delayed, as Thomas was, in obtaining his degree.</p>
<p>John was older than Thomas by several years, having been born
in 1221. He had been recovered from an apparently mortal illness
through the prayers of Francis of Assisi in his third year, and
then received the name Bonaventura from the good man&rsquo;s own
lips. He entered the order in his twenty-second year, and
studied in Paris under Alexander of Hales and John of Rochelle.
The devout humility of the man, and his purity of character, produced
as deep an impression upon his teachers as Thomas had
produced upon his by the force and keenness of his intellect.
Alexander used to say that &ldquo;in Brother Bonaventura Adam seems
not to have sinned.&rdquo; John was probably the most perfect exemplar
of the spirit of Francis of Assisi that was to be seen in the
second generation of the order. Not by intellectual force, but by
humble ministry to the commonest human needs, by the infection
of an all-embracing love and the close imitation of our Lord&rsquo;s
humanity, he would save the world from its wanderings. Thomas
and he were the best possible representatives of their respective
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
orders, and it speaks well for both men that their differences only
bound them more intimately in friendship. Each reverenced
what was strongest in the other. When Thomas asked to see the
books by whose help John had acquired his Christian erudition,
the Franciscan pointed him to a crucifix, and said that from that
he had learned all that he ever knew.</p>
<p>Their answers to William of St. Amour reflect the character of
the men. Bonaventura defended the mendicant form of the monastic
life as an ideal; but without admitting the truth of the dark
picture William had drawn, he conceded that serious abuses had
crept in, and that already there was need of a reformation unless
matters were to be let grow worse. Thomas makes no concessions
whatever. He entitles his book <i>Against those who Assail the
Worship of God and the Monastic Life</i> (<i>Contra Impugnantes Dei
Cultum et Religionem</i>). William and all who hold with him are
the enemies of God and of His Church. The critics of the Mendicant
rule are standing in the way of the forces which are sent of
God to win the world to Christ. The monk, and especially the
mendicant friar, is the only thorough Christian who keeps to the
&ldquo;counsels of perfection&rdquo; our Lord gave His disciples, as well as to
the precepts of obedience obligatory upon all. William uttered
false and damnable doctrine when he tried to limit them to a
purely ascetic life. They have the right to teach as well as to pray
and mourn, and the Pope has power to open to them the doors
of every secular college by his mandate.</p>
<p>The controversy was brought to an end in 1257, when Pope
Alexander IV. at Anagni formally condemned the book of William
of St. Amour, and bound the plenipotentiaries of the university by
an oath to admit the Mendicants to their former footing in the
university. And to signalize the victory of the friars, Thomas and
Bonaventura were admitted to the doctorate on the same day,
October 23d, 1257.</p>
<p>From the masters the head of the school in St. Jacques Street
was chosen by the General of the Order, and naturally the choice
fell on Thomas. Usually the place was held for a year only, and
its occupant then transferred to some other field of labor. Thomas
held it for four years, lecturing, preaching at least every Lent in
the adjacent church, and exercising the discipline of the order
over its students. The number who heard his lectures must have
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
been great. The school at Paris, unlike that at Koeln, being a
branch of the university, its lectures were open to all comers, and
the renown of the Italian who had been more than a match for
the ablest of the secular doctors would draw hearers. And those
who came once, if they had any love for the play of pure intelligence
and the fearless handling of great questions, would come
again. Thomas, with all his orthodoxy, was a pretty thorough
rationalist. He had full faith in the capacity of the human understanding
to deal fruitfully and safely with the deepest mysteries.
If his conclusions always are with the Church, it is not because he
has shrunk from attending to, and even suggesting, what might
be said against the doctrine under consideration. It is because he
has satisfied himself that the balance of logical argument, after all
objections have been weighed, is on the side of orthodoxy. In
this respect his writings represent the highest point reached by the
rationalistic tendency in the Middle Ages, just as Abelard represents
its initiation. We find Duns Scotus, his great Franciscan
rival, shrinking from his rationalism, and removing some of the
mysteries of theology out of the field of logical discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, his most devoted hearers were the young men of the
order. Of these some ninety were sent up every year from the
schools in the provinces outside France; and in addition to these
picked men, who came for the master&rsquo;s degree, Paris had the
training of all the students of Northern France. Some of the
former were from Spain, where the order was engaged in combatting
the Mohammedan doctors. Their needs drew Thomas&rsquo;s attention
to the subject of his first systematic work, the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i>. Thomas puts himself upon the level of one who has no
Christian convictions, but argues simply from principles of philosophic
truth and of natural religion accepted by both parties.
Besides these and other literary labors he attended the annual General
Chapters of his order at Valenciennes in 1259, where he and
Albrecht drew up the new order of studies for the young Dominicans.</p>
<p>In 1261 Michael Palaeologus, the Greek Emperor of Nicea,
conquered Constantinople, and thus put an end to the Latin
Empire established by the Fourth Crusade. But the wily Greek
feared a general movement in Latin Christendom to recover the
city from him, and to gain time by diplomacy he opened negotiations
for the reconciliation of Eastern and Western Christendom
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
with Urban IV., then newly chosen to the papacy. The Pope
summoned Thomas Aquinas from Paris to Rome, to aid in these
negotiations by his erudition and acuteness. The subject was one
into which his previous studies had not conducted him, but a
scholastic philosopher must be prepared to write on any topic.
<i>De omni scibili</i> was his scope. So Thomas wrote his <i>Treatise
against the Errors of the Greeks</i> (<i>Opusculum contra Errores
Graecorum</i>) by the papal order. In its preparation he became at
once the victim and the instrument of one of the most memorable
forgeries in ecclesiastical literature. The Dominicans had followed
the Latin Empire into the East, but found themselves at a loss for
authorities to prove to the Greeks that the autocratic papacy was
a venerable, much less a primitive institution, of the Christian
Church. One of them conceived the bright thought of manufacturing
a supply. So he sent to Urban IV. a long <i>catena</i> of quotations
from the Greek fathers, especially the two Cyrils and the
Council of Chalcedon, in which the papal authority and infallibility
were set forth with a boldness never used even in the West. The
Pope fully believed in their genuineness and handed them over to
Thomas, who incorporated many of them into his <i>opusculum</i>,
besides using them in his greater work. He knew too much
about the teachings of the Greek fathers not to be staggered by the
quotations as to the Procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father
and the Son, and he expressed his doubts in a letter to Urban.
But he was not staggered by the forger&rsquo;s showing that the Greeks
accepted the universal jurisdiction and infallible authority of the
papacy. In this way the notion of a universal episcopate and an
infallibility in the Bishop of Rome, from being the audacious
whim of a few canonists, passed into the dogmatic theology of the
Church, and came to be made an article of faith in our own time.
(See Acton-D&ouml;llinger-Huber&rsquo;s book, <i>Janus, or the Pope and the
Council</i>, chap, iii., section 18.)</p>
<p>Urban IV. having brought Thomas to Italy, Clemens IV. kept
him there as long as he lived, making him a professor in the university
established by Innocent IV. within the Roman Curia, and as
such carried him about from city to city as the Papal Court removed,
and had him lecture on theology wherever the Court was staying.
He also set him to the work of writing commentaries on part of
the Scripture: Job, the Psalms, Canticles, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, besides his <i>catena</i> of comments on the Gospels
gathered from the Latin fathers. Most important of all for our
purposes, he asked him to prepare the service for Corpus Christi
Day&mdash;a festival established in 1264. It was for this that Thomas
wrote four of the hymns which have given him his place in
the annals of hymnology, and those are his finest. And it is
said that he also began his <i>Summa</i> in these years, but that I
doubt. But in 1269 Clemens died, and it was two years before
another Pope was elected. Thomas took the opportunity to
escape out of the throng and noise of the Curia, and made his way
back to France and to his old manner of life. He came back to
Paris and lectured in St. Jacques Street, but not as the head of the
school. At Paris he now found critics as well as admirers. His
doctrine that individuality is dependent upon matter was censured
as involving a denial of immortality, and in 1269 he wrote a
treatise, <i>Contra Averroistas</i>, to show that this was not a necessary
or even a fair inference. In the same year we find him in London
attending a Chapter General of his order.</p>
<p>In 1271 the vacancy in the papacy ended with the selection of
Gregory X., one of the best of the popes. Thomas was recalled
to Italy and offered the Archbishopric of Naples, doubtless at the
suggestion of Charles of Anjou, whose hands were red with the
blood of the young Conradin. Thomas wisely declined it, and
when, in 1272, he agreed to go to Naples as a teacher of theology,
it was with the reservation that this should not bring him into close
relations with the Court. Enough of his Ghibelline traditions
clung to him to make him abhor the murderer of his kinsman.
So in Naples he taught, and wrote at his <i>Summa</i>, and prayed and
saw visions&mdash;his biographers say&mdash;until one day the Pope summoned
him to a General Council at Lyons, with the view of proclaiming
a new crusade. He obeyed the summons, but when he
reached the Cistercian monastery of Fossa Nuova, on the hills above
the Pontine Marshes, below Rome, he fell ill and died, March 7th,
1274. Of course the Italians knew he was poisoned, and even Dante
countenances the report. The Pontine Marshes in spring are so
wholesome that no other hypothesis could account for his death!
His friend Bonaventura reached Lyons, but died during the sessions
of the council. His earlier friend and master, Albert the Great, although
his senior by thirty years, outlived him by six, dying in 1280.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>The position of Thomas Aquinas in history is determined by
the fact that he is the greatest of the scholastic philosophers.
What his master and other earlier thinkers had attempted, he more
nearly did than ever has been done by any one else. He took
the two great bodies of knowledge, secular and sacred, and fused
them into a system more nearly consistent with itself than any
other. On the one side was the encylopaedic philosophy of Aristotle,
and the parallel but less perfect tradition of Platonic speculation;
on the other the Scriptures, the dogmatic decisions of the
councils and popes, and the teachings of the recognized authorities
among the ecclesiastical writers, especially as these had been summarized
by Peter Lombard. To blend these into one great system
of theology, to subsidize the weapons of the Greek philosophy in
defence of Christian truth, and to draw the line with accuracy
between what reason can prove and faith accepts without proof&mdash;this
was what he undertook in the <i>Summa</i>. And never was a
more acute intellect employed on the great task of reconciling faith
with reason. If he failed, it is not because he shrank from anticipating
any and every kind of objection to the truths he was defending;
his works are a perfect storehouse of such objections.
If he failed, it was not from any want of confidence in the powers
of the human mind to deal with the highest subjects of thought.
No modern rationalist ever surpassed him in that respect. He
failed because neither then nor now do the materials exist for such
a work, and because his truths lost and his errors gained force by
being worked into a system.</p>
<p>It would take a whole chapter even to describe the <i>Summa</i>.
Of its three parts, the first, concerning God, and the second concerning
man, were completed in the four years he gave to the
work. In the third, which treats of the God-Man, he got no
farther than the ninetieth question, and the discussion was completed
by extracts from his commentary on Peter Lombard. But
the completed part contains nearly <i>two million</i> Latin words, or with
the supplement, two million one hundred thousand. It is six
times as large as Calvin&rsquo;s <i>Institutio</i>, or four times as large as the
Latin Bible! And the <i>Summa</i> fills only two of the seventeen
folios of his works, all written within the space of twenty-six years
by a man actively engaged in teaching, lecturing, and advising
popes and princes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>That so much of the formative period of his life was spent in a
controversy, in which he was the applauded spokesman of a party
whose cause he regarded as the cause of God, could not but affect
his intellectual character. Professor Maurice thinks the delay in
obtaining the master&rsquo;s degree worked in the same direction. The
master in those days was expected to pronounce decisions; those
who had not attained that rank were occupied in disputations
only. &ldquo;Thus our author was a trained arguer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the old
habits remained with him when his decisions were most accepted
as authorities. From first to last he was thinking of all that could
be said on both sides of the question he was discussing.&rdquo; I
believe that he was conscious of the narrowing and dwarfing tendency
of this habit of mind, even though he did not detect the
source of the evil. We read of his seeking to prepare himself for
his work by humble devotion. But to the last line of his last
work the controversial habit and attitude of mind clings to him.
It is only in his catechetical expositions, written before he left
Koeln for Paris, that you find a different atmosphere, and escape
the heretic-crushing Aristotelian dialectic of the scholastic disputant.</p>
<p>Even in his few hymns, which constitute his title to rank among
the sacred poets, he is the great scholastic doctor, with his eye on
the heresies which may distract the believer. He writes with the
full panoply under his singing robes. All his hymns are concerned
with the greatest of the Christian sacraments. It was in
1215, a year before the confirmation of the Dominican Order, and
twelve years before Thomas was born, that the fourth Lateran
Council made the transubstantiation of the elements into the body
and blood of Christ an article of faith. But a Belgian ecstatic,
Juliana of Liege, had a vision which called for a special annual
festival in honor of the mystery. Urban IV. complied with
this request in 1261, by requiring that the Thursday next after
Trinity Sunday should be observed as Corpus Christi Day. This
involved the preparation of an additional services for the Missal
and Breviary, with suitable prayers and hymns, and the work was
laid upon Thomas. For the Missal he wrote the sequence</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Lauda, Sion, Salvatorem;</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and for the Breviary the three hymns</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<dl>
<dd><i>Pange, lingua, gloriosi Corporis mysterium,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Sacris solemniis juncta sint gaudia,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Verbum supernum prodiens, Nec Patris.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Paris Breviary connects a fifth hymn of his with the same
festival, the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Adoro Te devote, latens Deitas,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>assigning it for late (<i>serotinas</i>) services in the octave of Corpus
Christi. So Newman; but Daniel declares he finds it in none of
the breviaries of modern use, and in the missals only as a part of
the priest&rsquo;s private preparation for saying Mass. Even this rank
has not been attained by the sixth hymn ascribed to him, the
beautiful</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>O Esca viatorum,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>which Dr. Ray Palmer has made familiar to American worshippers
by his exquisite version, first published in the <i>Andover Sabbath
Hymn-Book</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>O Bread to pilgrims given.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moll denies that Thomas wrote this, and says it is by a Jesuit
poet, which is most probable. March calls it &ldquo;a happy echo&rdquo;
of the undisputed hymns of Thomas Aquinas. But the echo is
softened; the hymn is less masculine. <i>Lympha fons</i> alone would
serve as a note to show that Aquinas never wrote it.</p>
<p>It has been said by Dr. Neale that the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Pange, lingua, gloriosi</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>&ldquo;contests the second place among those of the Western Church,
with the <i>Vexilla Regis</i>, the <i>Stabat Mater</i>, the <i>Jesu dulcis memoria</i>,
the <i>Ad Regias Agni Dapes</i>, the <i>Ad Supernam</i>, and one or two
others, leaving the <i>Dies Irae</i> in its unapproachable glory.&rdquo; But
this judgment is the prejudiced one of a High Churchman, sufficiently
in sympathy with the Roman doctrine of the sacraments
to relish keenly Thomas&rsquo;s concise and vigorous statement of that
doctrine, and to mistake the relish for critical appreciation of the
poetry. Dr. Neale even praises Thomas&rsquo;s treatise <i>On the Venerable
Sacrament of the Altar</i> as the finest devotional treatise of the
Middle Ages, finer therefore than the <i>Imitation</i> itself! A calmer
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
estimate will put the hymn decidedly below Bernard&rsquo;s exquisite
<i>Jesu dulcia memoria</i>, or the <i>Veni, Creator Spiritus</i> of Rabanus
Maurus, or the <i>Veni, Sancte Spiritus</i> of Hermann Contractus. It
is true that it excels all these in its peculiar qualities, its logical
neatness, dogmatic precision, and force of almost argumentative
statement; but these qualities are not poetical. In this respect it
is not altogether unlike Toplady&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; a hymn in
which the intellect has cut a channel for the emotions to flow.
That was written as a tail-piece to a controversial article in which
Toplady discussed John Wesley&rsquo;s doctrines in the matter of faith
and works, and is a terse statement of theological discriminations
on that point.</p>
<p>The <i>Lauda, Sion, Salvatorem</i>, as it is a much longer hymn,
gives more scope for the exposition of the Roman doctrine. For
this reason Martin Luther abhorred it, probably also because he
had no good opinion of Thomas himself. He accuses him of
perverting the Scripture in this hymn, &ldquo;as though he were the
worst enemy of God, or else an idiot.&rdquo; But this harsh judgment
did not succeed in expelling the hymn from the use of the Lutheran
churches, and since the Oxford revival it has found its way into
other Protestant churches. But the sixth, seventh and eighth
verses express the doctrine of transubstantiation so distinctly, that
one must have gone as far as Dr. Pusey, who avowed that he held
&ldquo;all Roman doctrine,&rdquo; before using their words in any but a
non-natural sense. In the fine version made by Dr. A. R.
Thompson, first published in the <i>Sunday-School Times</i> in 1883,
and included in Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s <i>Laudes Domini</i>, only half the
hymn is given, those verses being taken which deflect least from
the general current of Christian thought about the sacrament. By
the author&rsquo;s kind permission, we give it here with his latest revision:</p>

<p>Thomas&rsquo;s Franciscan friend, John Fidenza, better known by his
nickname of John Bonaventura, was a hymn-writer also, but he
did a good many other things better. To many Protestants his
name has been made offensive through its association with the
<i>Psalter of Our Lady</i>, a travesty of the Book of Psalms, with which
he had nothing to do, and which was made in a later century.
Indeed, as Martin Chemnitz pointed out three centuries ago, Bonaventura
protested against the excessive reverence for the Virgin,
which had already become common, as likely to lead to idolatry.
That he was called the Seraphic Doctor shows that men felt in
him a warmth of heart and a tenderness of devotion, which they
missed in his greater contemporary, Thomas Aquinas, the Angelical
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
Doctor. Indeed he was the incarnation of the Franciscan
spirit of love and helpfulness, as Thomas of the Dominican spirit
of theological research and orthodox defence. Yet Bonaventura&rsquo;s
<i>Breviloquium</i> has been praised by good judges as the best compend
of Christian doctrine that the Middle Ages have left us.</p>
<p>Bonaventura&rsquo;s Latin poems are rather devout meditations than
hymns. They are not the voice of the Christian congregation in
song, but of the monk meditating before his crucifix. To him is
sometimes ascribed the Christmas hymn,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Adeste fideles,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>but not on sufficient authority. His best known hymns are the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Christum Ducem, qui per crucem,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Recordare sanctae crucis,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>of which latter we have English versions by Dr. Henry Harbaugh,
Dr. J. W. Alexander, and E. C. Benedict. Five other hymns
are ascribed to him in the collections. They all have the Franciscan
note; they turn on our Lord&rsquo;s human sympathy and sufferings.
This explains the ascription to him of a long hymn on the
members of our Lord&rsquo;s body as affected by the passion, which is
found in Mone (I., 171-74), but which is more frequently and
quite as erroneously ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux. It is not
worthy of either, although Mone thinks the ascription to Bonaventura
&ldquo;worthy of attention.&rdquo; The hymn furnishes the point
of contact of the Latin hymnology with that of the later Moravians,
the Franciscans of Protestantism.</p>
<p>So we leave the two great scholars, thinkers, doctors, and poets,
each representing one of the two chief streams of spiritual influence
in the Church of the thirteenth century. &ldquo;They were lovely
and pleasant in their lives, and in death they were not divided.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">JACOPONUS AND THE &ldquo;STABAT MATER.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Jacoponus, known to us sometimes as Jacobus de Benedictis,
and sometimes as Jacopo di Benedetto, or as Giacopone da Todi
from his Italian birthplace, is a most quaint and singular singer.
The name Jacoponus is a mere title of reproach, and signifies either
&ldquo;Big James&rdquo; or &ldquo;Silly James.&rdquo; It was called after him on the
street and he adopted it in a spirit of humility and as a badge of
self abnegation. The man himself was an Italian jurist and nobleman,
who lived in the thirteenth century. He led a wild life, lost
his property, and eventually regained it by industry and ability.
Evidently he neither cared nor scrupled about his ways of making
money. A crisis came in his life in consequence of his wife&rsquo;s
sudden death. She was killed at the city games of Todi in the
year of grace 1268, where with other women she had been watching
the sports from a scaffold of wood. It was insecure and fell,
killing her instantly. Poor Benedetto, on hurrying to the spot,
found that beneath her garments she had been wearing a hair
girdle next to the skin&mdash;according to the harsh custom of the
time&mdash;and he was deeply affected by this evidence of her anxiety
to please God. In those days such an action spoke volumes for
the victim&rsquo;s piety, and no one was more open to conviction than
this erratic, sensitive, and brilliant man.</p>
<p>But it would seem that for a long time he struggled against his
feelings, since we have a record that by 1298 he had been a religious
person about twenty years. Indeed, there is a story that
he was not received at once by the Minorites, and that he finally
produced certain poems before they grew satisfied to take him in.
However, when he was fairly within their walls he outdid all the
other Franciscans in austerity. He had given up his position as
Doctor of Laws and had surrendered his property; now it would
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
appear that he was determined to advance beyond the rest in
ascetic devotion. His penances and prayers were greatly in excess
of prescribed rules, and he must have proved as sore a trial
to any easy-going brother, as Simeon Stylites was when he too
led the whole convent to denounce his ascetic habits. There is
small doubt that the brain of Jacoponus was decidedly off its
balance, even in these earliest days, and his subsequent conduct
gave full evidence of his insanity. Still, we find in this self-abasement
of his nothing that looks like pride or egotism. Where
others display a complacency which is very Pharisaic, he only
shows the monomania of a gifted soul. Some of his expressions
are remarkable for their spiritual depth and power. Thus when
he was pressed to explain how a Christian can be sure that he
loves God, he replied, &ldquo;I have the sign of charity; if I ask God
for something, and He refuses me, I love Him notwithstanding;
and when He opposes me I love Him twice as much.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
would,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for the love of Christ, suffer with a perfect
resignation all the toils of this life, every grief, anguish, pain,
which word can express or thought conceive. I would also readily
consent that, on leaving life, the demons should bear my soul
into the place of tortures, there to endure all the torments due to
my sins; to those of the just who suffer in purgatory, and even of
the reprobates and demons if this could be; and that until the
day of the last judgment, and longer still, according to the good
pleasure of the Divine Majesty. And, above all, it would be to
me a great pleasure and supreme satisfaction that all those for whom
I should have suffered should enter heaven before me, and, finally,
if I came after them that all should agree to declare to me that
they owe me nothing.&rdquo; Surely no modern theologian has ever
stated the doctrine of &ldquo;self-emptiness&rdquo; in any shape which at all
compares with this!</p>
<p>Nor was he deficient in wit. &ldquo;I enjoy the realm of France,&rdquo;
he once said, &ldquo;more than does the King of France; for I take
part in all the happiness that comes to him and I haven&rsquo;t the care
of his business.&rdquo; At another time he entered the market-place
on all fours naked, a saddle on his back and a bit between his teeth,
for what symbolic purpose no one has ever explained. Again,
he literally tarred and feathered himself, covering his body with a
sticky oil and then rolling in feathers of various colors and kinds.
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
In this elegant wedding attire he made his appearance at his
brother&rsquo;s house to honor the marriage of his niece. The guests,
as might be expected, departed in confusion and disgust. But to
all remonstrances upon his conduct he retorted, &ldquo;My brother
thinks to illumine our name by his magnificence; I shall do it by
my folly.&rdquo; He was really a leaf taken out of Rabelais or Boccaccio&mdash;a
jester whose folly and wisdom were mingled unequally, much
in the fashion of that Wamba son of Witless, immortalized for us
in the pages of <i>Ivanhoe</i>.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s great mind had doubtless been shaken by his affliction
and by the gloomy theology of his time. Otherwise these
performances, so inconsistent with his genius, could never have
taken place. The irregularity of his productions, sometimes delicate
as the most graceful stanzas of the troubadours, and some
times as coarse and rough as Villon at his worst, are in exact proof
of this assertion.</p>
<p>In theology he was, to quote Ozanam, &ldquo;no longer a dogmatic
but a mystic.&rdquo; He really became the leader of a band of pure
and elevated minds which continued, by direct genealogy, through
Hugo and Richard of St. Victor, and Tauler down to St. Theresa,
Madame Guyon, F&eacute;nelon, and our own Thomas C. Upham. It
is an honor of no slight consequence to have inspired so much of
the spirit of the Apostle John into that turbid current of mediaeval
religion. And it does not surprise us, therefore, to find the <i>Cur
mundus militat</i> of Jacoponus credited to Bernard of Clairvaux, nor
the <i>Jesu, dulcis memoria</i> of Bernard attributed to Jacoponus. The
two men were very similar, but the opportunities of the French
abbot were infinitely superior to those of the Italian monk. And
after a very careful inquiry I remain convinced, like other hymnologists,
that these two great hymns have already been properly
assigned. It is certainly a staggering piece of testimony when the
latter is found in an old <span class="small">MS.</span> of Jacoponus&rsquo;s poems, precisely in
the form in which it appears in the most critical edition of the
writings of Bernard. And it is equally unsettling for us to come
upon the <i>Cur mundus militat</i> in the works of the saint, when we
know, on no doubtful evidence, that this was the passport of the
sinner into his Franciscan convent. Once more it is worth our
while to repeat the warning that any positive designation of Latin
hymns by their authors&rsquo; names must rest upon a firmer foundation
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
than the mere fact that they can be discovered in this man&rsquo;s or
that man&rsquo;s printed works.</p>
<p>Jacoponus also interests us in view of his Protestant spirit. He
never fancied Boniface VIII., and when that pope had a dream in
which he saw a great bell without a tongue, and consulted the
keen-witted friar upon its meaning, he received the reproof
valiant, &ldquo;Know, your holiness,&rdquo; said the undaunted monk,
&ldquo;that the great size of the bell signifies the pontifical power which
embraces the world. But take heed lest the tongue be that good
example which you will not give.&rdquo; For this and other liberties
which he took it is no wonder that he presently found himself in
prison, where he suffered everything patiently, and announced that
he would go out when Boniface was ready to come in. And this,
indeed, actually occurred. He was excommunicated, too, but
from this sentence Benedict XI. released him on December 23d,
1303.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from quoting some more of his religious
aphorisms and meditations which instinctively suggest to us the
pious musings of &Agrave; Kempis. Here is one: &ldquo;I have always
thought, and I think now, that it is a great thing to know how to
enjoy God. Why? Because in these hours of joy, humility is
exercised with respect. But I have thought, and I think now,
that the greatest thing is to know how to rest deprived of God.
Why? Because in these hours of trial, faith is exercised without
evidence, hope without attempt at fulfilment, and charity without
any sign of the divine benevolence.&rdquo; And here is a fragment
from his last poem: &ldquo;Love, I see that thou art transfiguring me,
and making me become Love like thee, so that I dwell no longer
in my own heart and that I know no longer how to find myself
again. If I perceive in a man any evil, or vice, or temptation,
I am transformed and I enter into him; I am penetrated with his
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that these poems were in the Latin
language in every instance. Very few of the entire number are truly
within our own sphere of research, and all those composed in
Italian are accessible to us only through a French prose translation.
But his &ldquo;Praise of Poverty&rdquo; deserves a place even in these
pages, for it reveals the nature of the poet and helps us to
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
comprehend the pathos and tenderness of his unregulated genius:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sweet Poverty, how much in truth</p>
<p class="t2">Should we love thee!</p>
<p class="t0">For, child, thou hast a sister named</p>

<p class="t2">At length in peace;</p>

<p class="t0">And gain our freedom by the things</p>

<p class="t2">With joy and rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Thine is the plenty of the heart,</p>
<p class="t2">And that is best!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is strangely incongruous with this almost idyllic gentleness
for us to find such a man hanging a coveted bit of meat in his cell
until the odor of its putrefaction disgusted the rest of the monks,
as well as put an end to his own craving for the forbidden dainty.
Then, too, we have several other anecdotes of his grim humor
and bold denunciation of sin. Take, for example, the story told
of his peculiar half-satirical conduct in an instance which Wadding,
the historian of the Franciscan Order, relates with great gusto. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
citizen of Todi, a relative of the poet, had bought a pair of
chickens, and not wishing to be inconvenienced by them, he said
to Jacoponus, &ldquo;Take them and carry them for me, if you please;
I don&rsquo;t care to burden myself with them.&rdquo; To which Jacoponus
answered, &ldquo;Trust me! I&rsquo;ll carry your chickens home.&rdquo; He
then went direct to the church of Fortunatus, in which his own
monument was afterward placed, and pulling up a gravestone he
thrust the chickens in and replaced the slab. The worthy citizen
on his return of course found no chickens, and therefore at once
hunted out Jacoponus in the public square and reproached him.
&ldquo;I took them to your house,&rdquo; retorted the Franciscan. &ldquo;But I
have just come from it and my wife says she has not seen you,&rdquo;
the Tudescan asserted. Thereupon Jacoponus took him to the
church and having removed the stone, said to him: &ldquo;Friend,
isn&rsquo;t that your home?&rdquo; The citizen, says Wadding, took his
chickens, being a man evidently of frugal mind, and, &ldquo;not without
fear, went his way absorbed in thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mad Solomon is at times so keen in his denunciations of
the corruption of the Church, and so evidently sincere in his own
religion, that more than one hymnologist has thought that his
folly was largely assumed as a guise under which he had greater
freedom. The court fool was a &ldquo;chartered libertine&rdquo; as to his
language, and when we read the epitaph of Jacoponus it seems as
if he had reversed the saying of Shakespeare and had stolen Satan&rsquo;s
livery to serve Heaven in. There is no question but that this satirical
freedom actually cost the poor jester some considerable share
of imprisonment, and this heightens the likelihood that he was
playing Brutus in order to abolish Caesar. Boniface VIII., whom
he had very plainly rebuked, was the one who imprisoned him,
and he was not released before the case&mdash;as he had indeed predicted&mdash;was
precisely reversed. Let me record my own conviction,
based upon the poem of which I append a translation, and upon
the other facts of his life, that this view of his career has much in
its favor. Those days and these are not to be compared in respect
to liberty. Where Bernard of Cluny swung his sling about his
head and let the pebbles fly to right and left with no very tangible
result, Jacoponus took bow and arrows and drove his shaft into
the target. No one meddled with Bernard; but Jacoponus, a
century later, was a Tell for the ecclesiastical Gessler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>Of the <i>Stabat Mater Dolorosa</i>, carried by the Flagellants into
every corner of Europe as they flogged themselves in public to its
anthem, it can be said that it is one of the very greatest hymns&mdash;if
not actually the greatest&mdash;of the Roman Catholic Church. The
<i>Dies Irae</i>, the <i>Veni, Sancte Spiritus</i>, and the Hymn of Bernard of
Cluny, are catholic rather than Roman. This is Roman rather
than catholic. It is full of Mariolatry. Take a stanza from a
prose translation by way of example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virgin of virgins, illustrious, be not now bitter to me, make
me mourn with thee, make me carry about the death of Christ,
make me a sharer in His passion, adoring His suffering.&rdquo; And
again: &ldquo;O Christ, when I go hence, give me, through Thy
mother, to attain the palm of victory,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>For this reason the Protestant metrical versions of the <i>Stabat
Mater</i> are few in number and generally accompanied by disclaimers
of one kind or another. Of course the music, on whose wings
the hymn has now flown world-wide, will need no word of mine.
If the <i>Stabat Mater</i> itself receives commonly the second rank
among hymns, it follows that Rossini, Pergolesi, Palestrina and
Haydn have not detracted from its glory. And though in the
terse language of one of our best hymnologists, we say, &ldquo;It is
simple Mariolatry, most of it,&rdquo; the human pathos of the verses
appeals strongly to those who refuse the added errors of the poem.</p>
<p>Of the <i>Stabat Mater Speciosa</i> I confess to a decided doubt. It
is in the nature of a paraphrase, almost of a parody. It is unworthy
of the brain that formed the <i>Mater Dolorosa</i>, and the jester
must have gone beyond common folly if he descended to this imitation
of himself. It is more likely&mdash;and there is good ground for
the opinion&mdash;that it is the work of some later hand. Archbishop
Trench, by the way, will not include either of them in his collection.</p>
<p>Of the other writings of Jacoponus it may be interesting to say
that he composed hymns and satires in great abundance, both in
Latin and in Italian, which were collected by Franciscus Tressatus,
a Minorite brother, and published in seven books. The <i>Cur
mundus militat</i> (which Wadding quotes at length) meets this editor&rsquo;s
highest praise. Of the Italian poems we can say that they are
now regarded by Symonds and others as the fountain-head of Italian
literature, and that they contained many of the crude expressions
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
of the common people mixed with an elegance of phraseology to
which Dante and Petrarch were accustoming their mother tongue.
Indeed, I know no other similar poet, unless it be John Skelton,
rector of &ldquo;gloomy Dis&rdquo; in England, who about a century later
shot the same kind of shafts at the same manner of target and with
much the same bitter, gibing wit.</p>
<p>But of all the compositions of our mad monk which I have
seen, I am most especially interested in this <i>Cur mundus militat</i>.
Its attractiveness consists, first of all, in its dactylic measure and in
its singular adaptation to the character of Jacoponus. It is hard,
in the translation, to catch that strange jingle of the cap and bells
and that tossing of the fool&rsquo;s bauble which accompany the exhortation.
Only in the last stanza does it appear as if he deigned to
be serious. All that precedes this is the quaint world-weariness of
the man too wise for his time, and who is therefore well pleased to
be <i>stultus propter Christum</i>&mdash;a &ldquo;fool for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are not to imagine that these stirring verses, whether in
Latin or in Italian, went unnoticed. In the various productions
of his muse the humble monk enjoyed a popularity like that of
Abelard. Numerous manuscripts of his writings were scattered
through Italy, France, and Spain, and translations in these different
languages helped to increase his fame. Between the fifteenth
and seventeenth centuries at least eight editions appeared.
But for critical purposes they are not so valuable as might be supposed,
since there are interpolations by other hands which confuse
and deter the investigator. They were supplemented in 1819 by
the publication of a number hitherto unknown, which were edited
by Alessandro da Mortara.</p>
<p>Of the Latin poetry ascribed to him the <i>Jesu dulcis memoria</i> is
certainly Bernard&rsquo;s, for Morel discovered it in an Einsiedeln <span class="small">MS.</span>
&ldquo;older than 1288.&rdquo; There are two hymns&mdash;<i>Crux te, te volo conqueri</i>
and <i>Ave regis angelorum</i>&mdash;of which we merely know the
opening lines and have no accessible originals. The <i>Verbum caro
factum est</i>, the <i>Ave fuit prima salus</i>, and the <i>Cur mundus militat</i> are
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
doubtless his own. The <i>Mater Speciosa</i> I take the liberty to discredit
because of its gross Latinity&mdash;a point which Ozanam concedes in
spite of his belief in its genuine character. The <i>Mater
Dolorosa</i> itself has not escaped question, for Benedict XIV. declared
it to be the work of Innocent III., to whom, with about the
same amount of truth, has also been attributed the <i>Veni, Sancte
Spiritus</i>.</p>
<p>In the year 1306, after imprisonment and excommunication
had both passed over his head and spent their force harmlessly,
the aged Jacoponus drew near his end. His companions urged
him to ask for the final sacrament, but he was in no haste. He
would wait, he said, for John of Alvernia, his true friend, and
from his hands only would he receive it. They considered this
another proof of his untamed and rebellious nature, and loudly
lamented around his bed. But the dying man gave no heed to
their weakness. He raised himself upon his arm and with lifted
face began to chant the <i>Anima benedetta</i>&mdash;the song of a blessed
soul. Scarcely had his voice uttered the closing words ere two
men were seen hastening across the field. One was that very John
of Alvernia, moved by some strange presentiment to visit his
friend. He entered the room and greeted Jacoponus with a kiss
of peace. Then he administered the sacrament of the Eucharist.
And thereupon the failing singer, his desire being at last fulfilled,
sang the <i>Jesu nostra fidanza</i> and relapsed into silence for a time.
Then he exhorted those about him to live holy lives, and, lifting
his hands toward heaven, gently expired. It was on Christmas
eve and, in the neighboring church, the choir had just begun to
chant the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>.</p>
<p>Two hundred and ninety years after his death his tombstone and
its inscription were placed. The words, when rendered from
Latin into English, are these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bones of the blessed Jacoponus de Benedictis of Todi,
who, a fool for Christ&rsquo;s sake, deluded the world by a new art and
took heaven by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is in the Lenox Gallery a small picture by Zamacois,
which represents a jester leaning against a head of Pan. The rude,
broken bust stands on an antique pedestal, its mouth, in its half-tragic,
half-comic curves, appearing to whisper into the ear of its
companion. He, scarlet-clad and with his bauble swinging idly
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
in his hands, inclines his head toward it and seems in a sad gravity
to listen to its words. There, indeed, do I see Jacoponus! The
eager heart of the great misunderstood, inconsistent, vain, and
empty World tells him of its nothingness&mdash;a broken and abandoned
deity deserted in its garden of Eden. An inexpressible sadness
comes over me. Quietly I put by the <i>Stabat Mater</i>; I do not
love it!&mdash;but I close the page softly over the poor mad prophet
who rests his weary head on the steps of Solomon&rsquo;s throne.</p>

<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">THOMAS &Agrave; KEMPIS.</span></h2>
<p>The contributions of Holland to the devotional poetry of Christendom
have not been extensive; but in the Middle Ages she
could show several Latin hymn-writers. The best known of these,
however, is by far more famous for his prose works. Thomas
Hemerken, called afterward Thomas &agrave; Kempis, was not by birth
a Hollander. He was born in 1379 or 1380 at Kempen, a
small city in the diocese of Koeln (Cologne), not far from what
became the boundary line between the two nations. But in those
days, and, indeed, until the Peace of Westphalia, Holland, like
Switzerland, was reckoned a part of Germany. His father, John
Hemerken, was an artisan of the poorer class, probably a silversmith;
and both his parents were devout and God-fearing people.
His elder brother John had gone to Deventer to obtain an education,
after the fashion of the times, when boys wandered from city
to city in search of instruction, and supported themselves by singing,
begging, and sometimes by thieving. But at Deventer John
had fallen in with some good people who had pity upon these
wandering scholars, and had made arrangements to furnish them
lodgings and copying-work in addition to what they would earn
by singing in the choir.</p>
<p>The chief person in this group was Gerard Groote, a man of
wealthy family and some strange vicissitudes in life. He had
studied at the universities of Paris and Prague, and had taken
minor orders to qualify himself to hold the two canonries family
influence secured to him, but without giving any indication of a
vocation to the sacred office. He seems even to have led a dissolute
life. Then a great change came over him, chiefly through
the influence of a friend of his youth named Henry Eger, now the
prior of a Cistercian convent at Munkhuisen. Gerard resigned his
benefices, and spent five years in a monastic retreat, from which
he emerged as a zealous preacher of the Gospel to the clergy and
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
people of what now is Holland, using both Latin and Dutch as
occasion served. He especially dwelt on the utter worldliness
of that dreary time, when priests, nobles, and tradesmen alike had
lost all idea of serving God and men, and had set up gain and
pleasure as the recognized ends of life. His sharp rebukes, and
his exaltation of humility, simplicity, and poverty, attracted the
lower classes, but roused the opposition of both the burghers and
the Mendicants against him. After a brief and stormy career he
was silenced by the Archbishop of Utrecht, and was obliged to
find vent for his zeal in some other channel.</p>
<p>His purity and unworldliness had gathered around him, in his
native Deventer, men and women like-minded with him, who,
according to the tendency of the time, drifted naturally into a kind
of monastic life. Brother-houses and sister-houses were organized,
and they became known as the Brethren and Sisters of the Common
Life. They took no vows, and yet practised celibacy, common
ownership and labor, and obedience to the rector of the house.
They adopted no common dress, but came to wear the simplest
gray robe of the same cut. Both laymen and clergy lived together
in the brother-houses, and each took his turn in the common services
of the brotherhood. They observed no canonical hours
beyond what the Church exacted of the priests among them.
They assumed none of the professions of the monks, and yet they
realized the monkish ideal better than did the monks themselves.
The four principles which governed Gerard&rsquo;s own life and became
the four corner-stones of this fraternity, were &ldquo;contempt of the
world and of self, imitation of the lowly life of Christ, good-will,
and the grace of devoutness&rdquo; (<i>contemptus mundi et sui ipsius, imitatio
humilis vitae Christi, bona voluntas, gratia devotionis</i>). All this was
summed up in the phrase <i>moderna devotio</i>, used both by the brethren
and the outside world to designate the distinctive character of
the order.</p>
<p>The experience Christendom had had of the results of mendicancy
led Groote and his associates to base the new brotherhood
on honest labor. The shape this took reflects his own character.
He was a great book-lover&mdash;<i>semper avarus et peravarus librorum</i>,
he says himself. When in peril of his life in a storm by sea, he
managed to save the six books he had with him. He possessed a
considerable library, and when the brotherhood came to adopt the
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
principle of community of goods, he and the rest put their books
into the common stock. And all who were able to write were to
labor in copying books for sale&mdash;the clergy in Latin, the laymen in
Dutch. It was this employment he extended to the poor scholars
of the Deventer school. Indeed, it seems not improbable that he
began it with them, and that the first brotherhood was composed
of young friends of this class, who had grown to manhood in this
employment. It is certain that in Deventer, in Zwolle, and for
all we know in the other cities where the brotherhood took root,
near by the brother-house stood a poor-scholars&rsquo; house, in which
the boys attending the school of the city were lodged, kept under
discipline, and to some degree given work also. But the Brethren
of the Common Life were not an educating body, as has
been very generally supposed. They aimed only at saving boys
from the moral injury which too often attended their homeless life,
at keeping good discipline over them, and at imparting moral and
religious training. They aimed to do for the school-boys what
the founders of colleges in the universities of Oxford, Cambridge,
and Paris tried to do for the myriads of students who lived like
vagrants in those seats of learning.</p>
<p>But before Gerard Groote died the question was raised whether
it would not be advisable to establish a strictly monastic order of
life for those of the brethren who felt a vocation to it. To this
he agreed, but dissuaded his friends from adopting the severe
rules of the Cistercians and the Carthusians for the new order.
Rather he suggested that of the Canons Regular under the rule
of St. Augustine as preferable, since it would be more in keeping
with the spirit of the brotherhood, and would bind on no one too
heavy burdens. This advice marks an advance upon Dominic,
Francis, and the &ldquo;reformers&rdquo; of the Benedictine and Mendicant
orders, in an evangelical direction. They all sought progress to
perfection in deeper austerity. In his case the preference perhaps
was caused by his friendship for the monastery of Canons Regular
at Groenendal, in Flanders, whose prior was Jan Rusbroek, the
great Flemish mystic. Gerard made several visits to Groenendal
after his conversion, and translated two of his friend&rsquo;s books into
Latin.</p>
<p>Gerard Groote was carried off by the great pestilence of 1384, in
his forty-fourth year. But he left the work in good hands, for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
Deventer priest named Florens Radewinzoon succeeded him as
rector of the brother-house, and proceeded with the building of
the new monastery at Windesheim, near Deventer. It was opened
in 1386, and John &agrave; Kempis, who had become a member of the
brotherhood, was one of the six who first assumed the monastic
vows.</p>
<p>It was six years later, in 1392, that Thomas set out to seek his
brother at Deventer; for although the distance was not much over
a hundred miles, he had heard nothing of John&rsquo;s profession at
Windesheim, so uncertain and irregular were the means of communication.
On learning what had happened, he proceeded to
Windesheim, where his brother welcomed him warmly. But
there was no school at Windesheim, and John advised him to return
to Deventer to attend the city school and place himself under
the care of Florens. He did so and became an inmate of the
poor-scholars&rsquo; house, which had been given to the brotherhood by
a devout matron of the city. Here he lived for six years, attending
school under Master Johann Boehme, singing in the choir of
the church of which Florens was vicar, and earning a little money
by copying books for him. The good rector showed him very
great kindness, and in 1398, when his school studies were complete,
he received him into the brotherhood. The year before this
another pestilence had visited Deventer, carrying off Johann Kessel,
the saintly cook of the brother-house, and prostrating Thomas
himself, who recovered with difficulty. Indeed, it seemed as
though the brotherhood would become extinct, and Florens and
six others withdrew for a time from the plague-smitten city to
guard against this catastrophe.</p>
<p>In 1399 Thomas, at Florens&rsquo;s instance, decided to assume the
monastic vows. A second house of the order had been established
at Agnietenberg (or Mount St. Agnes) near the city of Zwolle.
Of this John &agrave; Kempis had been made the second prior in 1398,
and held that office until 1408. Thither Thomas proceeded in
1399, stopping at Zwolle to obtain the indulgence lately proclaimed
by the Pope for the benefit of a new church in that city.
After a novitiate of seven years he took the vows in 1406, and in
1414 was ordained to the priesthood.</p>
<p>The monastic life is studiously and intentionally monotonous.
It aims at the exclusion of all that gives zest and interest to ordinary
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
existence, and at the reduction of life&rsquo;s employments to a
routine. Its variety and color are to be sought in the inner life of
its members, and that of Thomas was not wanting in these elements.
If his inner experience be reflected in his <i>Soliloquy of the
Soul</i>, he passed through those shifting seasons of gloom and gladness
which characterize the experience of an introverted religion.
His religious character was formed on the lines of the modern devotion,
as defined by Gerard Groote, and as reflected in the lives
and the writings of Florens Radewinzoon, Gerard Zerbolt, Johann
Mande, Gerlach Peterszoon, and Johann Brinckerinck, the earlier
notable men of the brotherhood or of the Windesheim congregation.
His was not a bold and originative mind to strike out new
paths for himself. He had not even those gifts of practical administration
for which Florens, John &agrave; Kempis, and others of the
order were notable. Even when he had attained recognition as
the most eminent man at Agnietenberg, his brethren twice
passed him by in selecting their prior, and never gave him any
dignity higher than the sub-priorate, which probably was a sinecure.
An early biographer goes so far as to describe him as sitting
silent whenever ordinary and worldly matters were discussed,
because of his ignorance of the very terms used at such times.
But this is an exaggeration. His <i>Chronicle of the Monastery of
Mt. St. Agnes</i> shows him taking a mild and not unintelligent interest
in the secular side of the monastic life, and sharing the joy
of his brethren in the fine apple-crop or the large take of fish, and
the like. But this <i>Chronicle</i> shows how limited his range of
vision and interest. He lived through the Papal Schism, the
Asiatic conquests of Timour, the Council of Constance, the Hussite
wars, Henry the Fifth&rsquo;s invasion of France, the exploits of
Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, the Council of Basle, the rise of the Medici in Florence,
and of the Duchy of Burgundy, the Council of Florence,
the exploits of Scanderberg and Hunyadi Janos, the Wars of the
Roses, the revival of letters, the invention of printing, the fall
of Constantinople, the Florentine Academy, the Portuguese discoveries
in the Atlantic, and much more that might be thought
likely to be discussed even within the walls of a Dutch monastery.
But the record is silent as to all these things; for the most part
they are part of the doings of that &ldquo;world&rdquo; which the disciples
of the modern devotion trained themselves to despise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>No doubt the great question of the Papal Schism was of interest
at Agnietenberg, and also the two great councils which brought it
to an end. At the Council of Constance the Brethren of the Common
Life were arraigned by a zealous Mendicant as violating Church
law by observing the three rules of the monastic life without
belonging to any recognized order. But this Mendicant notion
was declared heretical, thanks to two great French doctors, Pierre
d&rsquo;Ailly and John Gerson, the second of whom was to be associated
so closely with Thomas in a famous controversy.</p>
<p>In 1427 the troubles of the outside world did reach the convent
at Agnietenberg and its associates. There had been a disputed
election to the princely diocese of Utrecht, then one of the largest
and wealthiest in Latin Christendom. The Pope recognized one
candidate and the people of the cities another. To break down
their obstinacy the diocese was laid under an interdict, which put
an end to every act of public worship. Thereupon the brotherhood
and the order were given their choice by the citizens, either
to go on with their services as usual in church and chapel, or to
leave the diocese. With one consent they chose the latter alternative,
and in 1429 they distributed themselves among the associated
brother-houses and monasteries outside the diocese. The
twenty-four clerical and lay brethren of Agnietenberg found a
home at Luvenkerk in Friesland, in a disordered monastery which
had been placed under the rule of the Windesheim congregation,
and which they used this opportunity to reform. After three years
of exile they were allowed to return, a new Pope having yielded
to the people. But Thomas did not return so soon, for he had
been called away to Arnheim to the death-bed of his brother John,
the brother he had found at Windesheim instead of Deventer, and
under whose priorship at Agnietenberg he took the vows.</p>
<p>In 1451 Deventer was visited by a great Churchman and notable
thinker, the Cardinal Nicolas of Cusa, who, like Thomas, was
born east of what is now the German frontier, but had received
his schooling in Deventer, where he learned to love and honor the
Brethren of the Common Life. He came now as papal legate to
reform the abuses which had arisen in the churches of Germany
during the great schism; and when he came to his loved Deventer
he hastened to indicate his especial regard for his old friends.
He granted a special indulgence to both the brotherhood and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
order, and permitted the Windesheim congregation to establish a
second congregation, with equal privileges, to accommodate the
rapidly increasing number of convents of Canons Regular.</p>
<p>Thomas survived his brother by nearly forty years. His cloister
life moved on through three decades with the external monotony
of an existence subjected to rule. Five years of the forty were
years of pestilence and popular distress, which he duly chronicles.
But the only real interruption of his routine which still has a living
interest was his acquaintance with young Johan Wessel, who
came to pursue his studies in Zwolle, being drawn by the charm
of the <i>Imitation</i> into the neighborhood of its author. This probably
was about 1460, when he sought and made Thomas&rsquo;s acquaintance,
and often conversed with him upon the greatest of themes.
But the earliest biography of Wessel belongs to the next century,
and is by a Protestant pastor in Bremen; so the statements that
Wessel found Thomas and his brother monks all too superstitious,
and rebuked the Mariolatry of the author of the <i>Imitation</i>, are open
to doubt. That Wessel, the forerunner of Luther, influenced
Thomas in the writing of the <i>Imitation</i> is a palpable absurdity.</p>
<p>For a short time he was procurator or steward of the monastery,
a task which must have been uncongenial to him, but which he
would discharge with his best diligence, as his first biographer,
Jodocus Badius Ascensius, says he did. Then he was sub-prior a
second time in 1448.</p>
<p>The chronicle of Mount St. Agnes ends with January 17th, 1471;
its author died July 26th of the same year. His health had been
singularly good, but toward the close of his life he suffered from
dropsy. His eyesight never failed him, and he retained all his
faculties in full vigor to the last. As the end drew near, the sense
of all he had been to his brethren as a friend and counsellor
deepened in them at the prospect of losing him. All that their
love could do and his ascetic principles would permit, they did
to lighten the burdens and relieve the pains of his illness. He
died in his ninety-second year, after having been sixty-three years
in the order and fifty-eight in the priesthood.</p>
<p>He was buried within the cloisters of the monastery. There his
bones continued to rest even after the dissolution of the monastery
at the Reformation in 1573, and thence they were disinterred in
1672 and placed in a shrine. But no miracles were wrought at his
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
grave or by his bones. Whatever the faults of the Brethren of the
Common Life, it was not in the atmosphere of the modern devotion
that men learned to crave after such evidence of sanctity in the
servants of God. So the brotherhood and its affiliated order have
made no contributions to the list of Roman Catholic saints. There
is room in that long and motley list for Giovanni da Capistrano,
the cruel and implacable inquisitor, whose path across Europe
was marked with blood and fire. But none has been found for
the gentle and loving Thomas &agrave; Kempis, who has wooed millions
of souls to a closer communion with his Master, and whose own
life preached humility, patience, gentleness, renunciation of the
world, conformity to the will of God, and likeness to Christ, as
distinctly as does his great book. Well, he is content. <i>Ama
nesciri</i>&mdash;love to be unknown&mdash;was a precept often on his lips and
illustrated in his life. Of small matter to him would have been
the attempt to deny his authorship of the <i>Imitation</i>, and the controversy
of two centuries&rsquo; duration it provoked. Of no greater
moment the refusal of the name of saint to one whose only miracles
were wrought upon the spirits of his brethren. But the
Church catholic says of him, &ldquo;Surely this was a holy man of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the copying of books was the general employment of the
brotherhood and of the order, there was from the first a good deal
of independent authorship among them, and always on the lines
of the &ldquo;modern devotion.&rdquo; Groote himself labored chiefly by
preaching and correspondence. But some of his letters are tracts in
that form, and had a wide circulation as such. Florens was not
much even of a letter-writer, but he wrote one devotional tract
which has been discovered. It was in Gerard Zerbolt of Zutphen,
his <i>altera manus</i>, that he found a fit organ for the expression of
his ideas in writing. To us Protestants Zerbolt is memorable as
the author of a treatise asserting the right and duty of unlearned
men to have good books&mdash;the Bible and their prayer-books
included&mdash;in their own tongue. But he was much better known by
his writing certain widely circulated books of devotion&mdash;modern,
of course. Hendrik Mande, the Seer, was a Windesheim monk
whose mysticism took the bolder and more ecstatic flight of Rusbroek,
and like Rusbroek he found his native tongue more suitable
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
than Latin. Lastly, Gerlach Peterszoon, sometimes called
&ldquo;the second Thomas &agrave; Kempis,&rdquo; although he died in 1411,
before Thomas himself had become an author, wrote in both Latin
and Dutch sundry works, one of which still is reprinted for edification
even by Protestants. Through all this literature runs the
same strain of thought and feeling, in spite of personal differences.
They all insist on a deeper renunciation of the world than is satisfied
by any external monastic compliances. They all hold forth
the imitation of Christ&rsquo;s humility and meekness as the essence of
the Christian life. They all insist on devotion to the will of God
and good-will to men as the two essential channels in which the
Christian life must run.</p>
<p>Thomas &agrave; Kempis&rsquo;s works as a whole fit into the writings of
this group of disciples of Gerard Groote, just as his <i>Imitation of
Christ</i> fits into the rest of his works. He simply is the best writer
they had, as the <i>Imitation</i> is the best thing he ever wrote. If none
of the many manuscripts of the <i>Imitation</i> bore his name, as nearly
all of them do; and if none of the contemporaries who knew him
had certified to his authorship of it, as so many of them do; and
if none of the printed editions bore his name, as twenty-one of the
fifteenth century and forty of the sixteenth do, we still would
have been obliged to ascribe it to him. No other century than his
could have produced it. It reflects the ideas of no other group
than that of the disciples of Gerard and Florens. The very title,
<i>De Imitatione Christi, et de Contemptu Omnium Vanitatum Mundi</i>, expresses
the twofold aspect of the <i>moderna devotio</i> of which Gerard
and Florens were the sponsors. Among those disciples there is
no one but the author of the <i>Soliloquy of the Soul</i> and the <i>Valley
of Lilies</i>, to whom we could give it. It differs no more in point
of worth from Thomas&rsquo;s other books than does the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> from Bunyan&rsquo;s other writings, <i>Grace Abounding</i> always
excepted.</p>
<p>While it is by his formal hymns Thomas &agrave; Kempis acquires his
right to a place here, it is true at the same time that the <i>Imitation</i>
itself is a great Christian poem, not only in substance but in form.
A Belgian, who was his contemporary, says he had written the book
<i>metrice</i>, or in rhythm and rhyme. As it was printed always as
prose until our own times, this statement was somewhat puzzling,
as was the title, <i>Musica Ecclesiastica</i>, found in some of the manuscripts.
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
But Rev. Karl Hirsche, Lutheran pastor in Hamburg,
has vindicated both expressions by showing that Thomas has followed
such models as the sequence, <i>Victimae paschali</i>, in the composition
of his work. And he has given us an edition based on
Thomas&rsquo;s autograph of the year 1441, in which this peculiarity is
made visible.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
It is true that this way of writing what we may
call rhymed and rhythmical prose is not confined to Thomas or to
the <i>Imitation</i> among his works. Among others Jan van Schoonhooven,
a Belgian disciple of Jan Rusbroek&rsquo;s, uses this form frequently;
and Pastor Hirsche has pointed out its frequency in
others of Thomas&rsquo;s works. But in no other book approaching
the <i>Imitation</i> in length is the restriction of rhythm and rhyme so
steadily accepted. As an instance, take this brief passage from the
fifth chapter of the third book:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Amans volat, currit, et laetatur;</p>
<p class="t0">Liber est, et non tenetur</p>
<p class="t0">Dat omnia pro omnibus,</p>
<p class="t0">Et habet omnia in omnibus;</p>
<p class="t0">Quia in uno summo super omnia quiescit</p>
<p class="t0">Ex quo omne bonum fluit et procedit.</p>
<p class="t0">Non respecit ad dona</p>
<p class="t0">Sed ad donantem se convertit super omnia bona.</p>
<p class="t0">Amor modo saepe nescit,</p>
<p class="t0">Sed super omnem modum fervescit.</p>
<p class="t0">Amor onus non sentit,</p>
<p class="t0">Labores non reputat;</p>
<p class="t0">Plus affectat quam valet;</p>
<p class="t0">De impossibilitate non causatur</p>
<p class="t0">Quia cuncta sibi posse et licere arbitrator.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>Or in Rev. W. Benham&rsquo;s admirable version: &ldquo;He who loveth
flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not hindered. He
giveth all things for all things, and has all things in all things,
because he resteth in One who is high above all, from whom
every good floweth and proceedeth. He looketh not for gifts, but
turneth himself to the Giver, above all good things. Love oftentimes
knoweth no measure, but breaketh out above all measure;
love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labors, striveth after more
than it is able to do, pleadeth not impossibility, because it judgeth
all things which are lawful for it to be possible.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Imitation</i> has obtained a place next to the Bible in the devotional
literature of Christendom. The fact that the author was a
Roman Catholic and that the fourth book is a preparation for the
devout reception of the Eucharist in accordance with the Roman
Catholic theory of its nature, has not prevented stanch Protestants
from translating and commending it. Dr. Chalmers wrote a commendatory
preface to a Scotch reprint of John Payne&rsquo;s translation.
And in Germany, Holland, and England the Protestant versions
have far exceeded those made by Roman Catholics. The first
Protestant version was that from the mediaeval into Ciceronian
Latin, by Sebastian Castellio (Basle, 1556); the second was into
German by the great and good John Arndt. But the book has
achieved a still more notable conquest than this. In Corneille&rsquo;s
metrical version (1651) it was a favorite with Auguste Comte, who
recommended it to the Benthamist, Sir William Molesworth, as
well worth reading. It has obtained a sort of recognition among
Comtists as a canonical work, and selections from it often are read
at the Positivist services. And English readers will remember the
passage in which George Eliot, writing in Comte&rsquo;s spirit, describes
its effect on the sensitive spirit of Maggie Tulliver:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew nothing of doctrines and systems&mdash;of mysticism or
quietism; but this voice out of the far-off Middle Ages was the
direct human communication of a human soul&rsquo;s belief and experience,
and came to Maggie as an unquestioned message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is the reason why the small, old-fashioned
book, for which you need pay only sixpence at a book-stall,
works miracles to this day, turning bitter waters into sweetness,
while expensive sermons and treatises, newly issued, leave all
things as they were before. It was written down by a hand that
waited for the heart&rsquo;s prompting; it is the chronicle of a solitary
hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and triumph&mdash;not written on velvet
cushions to teach endurance to those who are treading with
bleeding feet on the stones. And so it remains to all time a lasting
record of human needs and consolations; the voice of a
brother who, ages ago, felt and suffered and renounced, in the
cloister, perhaps, with serge gown and tonsured head, with much
chanting and long fasts, and with a fashion of speech different from
ours, but under the same silent, far-off heavens, and with the same
passionate desires, and with the same strivings, the same failures, the
same weariness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Mill on the Floss, Book IV., chap.</i> 3.</p>
<p>All true; but less than the truth; for Thomas&rsquo;s power lies not
in these negations, but in his personal relation to &ldquo;the supreme,
invisible Teacher, the pattern of sorrow, the source of all strength,&rdquo;
from whom Marian Evans turned away to fill up her life with
&ldquo;yearnings and strivings and failures,&rdquo; while her only comfort
was in the consideration that she had stilled her pain by no &ldquo;false
anodynes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a little uncertain at what time the <i>Imitation</i> was written.
It seems not improbable that it was begun in Thomas&rsquo;s youth,
when he had assumed or was about to assume the responsibilities
of the priesthood. A lofty regard for the sanctity of that office
was one of the traditions of the brotherhood. Groote himself, in
view of the stains of his earlier life, never would assume it, although
his ordination would have enabled him to resume his work
of preaching through the Archdiocese of Utrecht. He never was
more than deacon, and the order which silenced him merely forbade
deacons to preach without especial permission. It is not
impossible that in the case of Thomas, as in that of Luther, the
responsibility seemed greater than he could bear, and that it drove
him into a closer and more consecrated fellowship with his Master,
which bore fruit in the first book of this wonderful manual. He
was ordained priest in 1414; there seems good reason to believe
that this first book&mdash;the <i>Imitation</i> proper&mdash;was known and read at
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
Windesheim, and even translated into Dutch by Jan Scutken, as
early as the year 1420; and that the other three were written, each
as an independent work, before 1425, and then united as one manual of
devotion.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>
The oldest manuscript of the Latin still in
existence bears the date 1425, and testifies to his authorship.
The oldest in Thomas&rsquo;s own handwriting was made in 1441, and
forms part of a series of his works, which he then collected probably
for the first time.</p>
<p>Of Thomas&rsquo;s purely poetical works, besides a few hortatory
poems and anagrams on the names of the saints, there were known
until recently sixteen <i>Cantica Spiritualia</i>, to wit:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Adversa mundi tolera</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Agnetis Christi virginis</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Ama Jesum cum Agnete</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Ave florens rosa</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Christe Redemptor omnium, Vere salus</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Christe sanctorum gloria, Et piorum</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Cives coeli attendite</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>En virginis Caeciliae</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Gaude, mater Ecclesia, De praecursoris</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Jesu Salvador seculi</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>O dulcissime Jesu</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>O Jesu mi dulcissime, Spes et solamen</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>O qualis quantaque laetitia</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>O vera summa Trinitas</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Tota vita Jesu Christi</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Vitam Jesu stude imitari</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In 1882 Father O. A. Spitzen found in a manuscript in Zwolle
ten other <i>Cantica Spiritualia</i>, which he published that year as the
work of Thomas &agrave; Kempis, to wit:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<dl>
<dd><i>Angelorum si haberem</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Creaturarum omnium merita</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Cum sub cruce sedet moerens</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Jerusalem gloriosa</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Mirum est si non lugeat</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Nec quisquam oculis vidit</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>O quid laudis, quis honoris</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Quanta Mihi cura de te</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Serve meus noli metuere</i>,</dd>
<dd><i>Ubi modo est Jesus, ubi est Maria</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Six of these had already appeared in Mone&rsquo;s collection, and
credited to a fifteenth century manuscript found at Carlsruhe, a
fact which does not militate against Spitzen&rsquo;s view of their authorship.
The latter found them along with the hymns generally
ascribed to Thomas in a <span class="small">MS.</span> which had belonged to the brother-house
in Zwolle, and had been written in the latter half of that
century, probably between 1477 and 1483. Most of them bear
the ear-marks of Thomas&rsquo;s style, and have a congruity with the
matter of his works which lends probability to Father Spitzen&rsquo;s
conjecture.</p>
<p>Of all these hymns two only have attained any recognition as
contributions to the sacred songs of Christendom. These two are the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Adversa mundi tolera</i>,</dd>
</dl>
<p>which is rather an exhortation in the tone of the <i>Imitation</i> than a
hymn; and the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>O qualis quantaque laetitia</i>,</dd>
</dl>
<p>better known, through the general omission of its first verse, as the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Adstant angelorum chori</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dr. Trench well says that the whole of our author&rsquo;s poetry will
not yield a second passage at all to be compared in beauty with
this. Indeed, most of Thomas&rsquo;s poetry lacks the inspiration
which characterizes his best prose. He is a poet in prose and a
prosy poet, and writes in verse because he has been required to fill
up some empty place in the hymn-list of his monastery. His
acquaintance with the hymn-writer&rsquo;s art is bounded by his daily
familiarity with the hymns of his breviary, and he betrays the fact
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
by starting from the first lines of well-known hymns in his own
work. But in this hymn on the joys of heaven he for once struck
the right key, although even here he shows some stiffness of the
joints, like a monk more used to a seat in the Scriptorium than
to the saddle of Pegasus. The hymn is known to English readers
by the admirable version of Mrs. Charles:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;High the angel choirs are raising</p>
<p class="t0">Heart and voice in harmony.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">FRANCIS XAVIER, MISSIONARY TO THE INDIES (1506-52).</span></h2>
<p>No man, since the days of the Apostles, has been more commended
for his zeal than Xavier. He has been the moon of that
&ldquo;Society of Jesus&rdquo; of which Ignatius Loyola was the guiding sun.
His privations, heroism, and success have been the constant theme
of the Roman Catholic Church. And it is impossible to study his
life without a conviction that there was in it a devout and gallant
purpose to bless the world.</p>
<p>Our limits and our line of thought alike demand of us that we
shall not attempt, in any exhaustive form, to treat of Francis Xavier
from the theologic or controversial side. He interests us, apart
from his personal character, simply because two Latin hymns have
been accredited to his pen. These have the same opening line,</p>
<dl>
<dd>&ldquo;<i>O Deus ego amo Te</i>,&rdquo;</dd>
</dl>
<p>but, after this exordium, they proceed quite differently. The
second of them, as we find it placed in Daniel&rsquo;s collection, has
received the greatest share of esteem, and is known to the entire
world of English-speaking Christians by the admirable translation
of Mr. Caswall:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My God, I love thee, not because</p>
<p class="t0">I seek for heaven thereby,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p>There is good reason to discredit its authorship, if this be a
question of accuracy with us. Schlosser&rsquo;s language (Vol. i., p.
407) would indicate that he regarded it as &ldquo;generally conceded&rdquo;
to be the &ldquo;love-sigh [<i>Liebesseufzer</i>] of the holy Francis Xavier.&rdquo;
But no proof has yet been offered which positively identifies this
hymn with its reputed composer. Its spirit&mdash;and that of its companion
lyric&mdash;is precisely his own. But so, it may be added, is the
spirit of that touching poem,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am old and blind&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Men point to me as stricken by God&rsquo;s frown,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>the same as that of John Milton, its once reputed author. No
true student of Milton&rsquo;s times or of Milton&rsquo;s language was ever
deceived by it; and the innocent and amiable Quaker lady of our
own century, who wrote it, was perfectly guileless in this impersonation
of his grief. But, nevertheless, it passed current for a
long time on the strength of some one&rsquo;s literary sagacity.</p>
<p>This species of argument is a very common inheritance to the
editors of Latin hymns, from Thomasius and Clichtove downward.
But it is quite as unsafe as to assign</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am dying, Egypt, dying,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>to the actual Mark Antony when we know it to have been written
by William Henry Lytle, an American, born in 1829 and dying
in 1863. Therefore, it is scarcely proper authoritatively to accredit
these hymns to Xavier, or, indeed, to any other poet. The utmost
that we can say for them is that no one can prove the converse of
the proposition, and that their style and form are appropriate to
the period at which he lived. He is not known to have written
other verses. These may have been the only exudations of that
bruised and wounded spirit which have hardened into amber and
thus have become precious to us. And we would prefer to believe
that he truly appears in these lines in such an exquisite mystic
apotheosis rather than to intermeddle with lower questions, and
so, perhaps, prevent any discussion of himself in these pages at all.</p>
<p>We have been prohibited by much the same destructive analysis
from treating of Augustine, who never wrote a hymn, and to
whom the <i>Ad perennis vitae fontem</i> has been wrongly ascribed, for
we know it now to be the undoubted composition of St. Peter
Damiani. In this and in other similar cases where there is any
literary question concerned, it may be worth our while to investigate
with great carefulness. As a rule, however, the internal evidence
offered in the hymns themselves will set us on the true path.
They range in structure from the lowest <i>corundum</i> up to the
choicest diamond, and are as various as any gems in their prosodic
form and spiritual color. Like these gems, also, they are notable
for varieties of crystallization&mdash;the Dark Ages showing imperfect
angles and crude attempts, and the Renaissance exhibiting again
the old sharp-cut classicism of a time anterior even to Hilary and
Ambrose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>From the higher critical standpoint, then, these hymns are not
unacceptable as Xavier&rsquo;s own work. They <i>feel</i> as if they belonged
to his age and to his life. They are transfused and shot through
by a personal sense of absorption into the divine love, which has
fused and crystallized them in its fiercest heat. It is proper to
inquire, moreover, if Xavier did <i>not</i> write them, who <i>did</i>? Their
author must have been as much superior to his own circumstances
and surroundings as Xavier was to his; and he must also have
been as much possessed by this same holy zeal. It is absolutely
incredible that, with these qualities given, he should not have
been known to us in other relations, and, sooner or later, identified
as the true source of their being. The sixteenth century was a
time when literary knowledge was closer and keener than it had
been in the twelfth, and a hymn of that period could not be attributed
to Heloise without exposing its own fallacy; for in the
<i>Requiescat a labore</i> we have such a comparatively modern lyric,
which Daniel rightly tests and finds wanting. &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;that this song is the production of a later age.&rdquo; And
he might well say it, for its crystallization, so to speak, is too
accurate, too many-sided, for it to belong in the twelfth century
and to the sad Abbess of the Paraclete.</p>
<p>One cannot, however, declare this so positively of Xavier&rsquo;s two
hymns. In style and composition the first is inferior to the
second; but both have a simplicity and directness of utterance
which may easily secure that pardon which their rhythm is faulty
enough to require. If one were to assign any special date to them,
it would naturally be in the neighborhood of that pathetic little
petition which comes from the prayer-book of Mary Queen of
Scots. The <i>Domine Deus, speravi in Te</i> is pitched in the same key
with these. And as Mary lived from 1542 to 1587, and Xavier from
1506 to 1552, there is certainly room for these two compositions
to have been prepared by another hand, in the days of enthusiasm
over his triumphant successes and of sorrow over his early death.</p>
<p>With these arguments for and against the authenticity of the
hymns, we must rest content. Bartoli and Maffei, in their Life of
Xavier, are silent upon the subject; and the careful K&ouml;nigsfeld
enters the better hymn in his collection as anonymous. If we retain
the reputed authorship ourselves, it must be, therefore, rather
as Christians than as scholars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>But, having done so, we are entitled to speak of Francis Xavier,
and of his life and his work. The date of his birth is apparently
fixed by a manuscript note in Spanish in a family record possessed
by the Xaviers, which places it upon April 7th, 1506. His father
was Don John Giasso, a man of legal acquirements and of good
social position. He was at one time auditor of the royal council
under King John III. For a wife he chose Donna Maria d&rsquo;Azpilqueta
y Xavier, and the child Francis was born at the castle of
Xavier, a few miles distant from Pampeluna in Navarre, on the
southern slope of the Pyrenees. He was the youngest of a large
family, and the castle where he saw the light gave to him the
patronymic by which he is always known. The family were originally
called Asuarez, but altered their name to Xavier when King
Theobald gave them this property. The mother&rsquo;s title was thus
perpetuated in one of her sons, but there seems to be some confusion
still remaining, for a brother of the missionary was Captain
John Azpilqueta, who also apparently had exchanged his father&rsquo;s
name of Giasso for one of the designations borne by his mother.</p>
<p>The biographies of Francis Xavier are naturally of a kind to excite
the critical instincts of a scholar. They are, from the original
life by Torsellini, to the latest Jesuit compilation, remarkable for
their enthusiasm and unlimited credulity. It is only in such
calmer treatises as those of Nicolini, Stephen, Venn, and others,
that we get the more just conception of his character. But to be
entirely fair to him we should take him from the picture painted
by his co-religionists, refusing only those things which are manifestly
incongruous or absurd. The work of Bartoli and Maffei
may, for example, be regarded as entirely safe in its general statements.</p>
<p>From the portraits left to us and preserved in the pages of
Nicolini and Mrs. Jameson, we derive a vivid impression of the
man&rsquo;s personal intensity. His eyes are deep and thoughtful; his
nose strong, rather blunt, and withal sagacious; and his face is
that of a mystic. He is usually represented as gazing upward in
religious rapture and his lips are parted. His features are more
rugged and forcible than refined. They indicate a rude strength
of body and of will rather than a delicate and sensitive nature.
Should we have met him personally, he would have given us the
impression of an enthusiast, deeply affectionate and profoundly
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
loyal to anything like a military organization. These opinions
would have been approved by the fact.</p>
<p>We read that his parents desired to educate him as a cavalier,
and that he was at first instructed at home in the usual topics.
But as he showed zeal and intelligence he was sent, in his eighteenth
year, to the College of Ste. Barbe at Paris. Here he completed
the study of philosophy, received the degree of Master, and
began to give instruction to others. His most intimate friend was
Peter Faber, afterward to become one of the earliest adherents of
Ignatius Loyola. And the biographers are unwearied in their
eulogy of Xavier&rsquo;s and Faber&rsquo;s purity of life and morals in the
midst of the great temptations of a corrupt city.</p>
<p>To these two young men, ardent of mind and eager in their
ambition, now enters the influence which shapes their destiny.
Faber was a Savoyard, poor and of humble birth, while Xavier was
well-to-do and possessed the haughty spirit of a Spanish grandee.
They were, however, kindling each other up to some scheme of
future glory when Ignatius Loyola made his way to Paris. He
had been converted a few years before this and had already begun
to gather proselytes to his opinions. His purpose in visiting Paris
was not merely to avail himself of better facilities for study, but
also to secure more followers. It is not strange to us that Loyola,
with his great sagacity, should have singled out the two companions
and have set himself to win them. Faber&rsquo;s allegiance,
indeed, it was an easy matter to obtain. But Xavier did not so
readily fall in with the wishes of the great general of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>Faber&rsquo;s conversion was rapidly accomplished. He was supplied
with the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>, which is, of all books, the best
adapted to produce the proper self-abandonment and plastic condition
of soul which befit the neophyte of the Society of Jesus. And
this work, composed, say the Roman Catholic authorities, in the
cavern of Manresa with the help of the Virgin Mary, may be regarded
as the keenest instrument by which men&rsquo;s lives were ever
carved into the patterns designed by a superior will. We have no
space for a discussion of Jesuitism further than to indicate its
methods when they affect the subject before us, but Faber&rsquo;s
behavior undoubtedly had its weight upon Xavier. The Savoyard
took to fasting with a perfect fury. In his debilitated condition
he was the fit vehicle for spiritual impressions, for ecstasies, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
for mystical dreams. He would kneel in the open court in the
snow, and sometimes allow himself to be covered with icicles.
His bundle of fuel he made into a bed and slept upon it for the
few hours of what one biography &ldquo;scarcely knows whether to call
torture or repose.&rdquo; In fact, he so outran the instruction of
Loyola, that that keen observer checked him and prevented what
would have reacted against his own designs. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; saith quaint
Matthew Henry, speaking of another subject, &ldquo;there is a great
deal of doing which, by overdoing, is altogether undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xavier was, however, more important to Loyola than Faber.
And Xavier was of tougher material and harder to reach. Upon
him the intense Loyola bent the blow-pipe flame of his own spirit.
He had failed to touch him by texts or by austerities. He therefore
changed his tactics altogether and began to soften him by
praise, by judicious cultivation of his sympathies, by procuring
new scholars for him, and even by attending his lectures and
feigning a deep interest in whatever he did. In short, he applied
flattery and deference in such a way that he insinuated himself
very soon into the confidence of Xavier, and allowed the haughty
Don to recognize the high birth and good breeding which he could
also claim. This was a master stroke. Faber was after all only a
Savoyard; but Loyola was born in a castle, had been a page at
the court of Ferdinand, and had led soldiers into the deadliest
places of battle. He had also the advantage of being Xavier&rsquo;s
senior by fully fourteen years, for his birth had been contemporaneous
with Columbus&rsquo;s expedition in search of the new world.</p>
<p>Here, then, the influence of this strong, undaunted, unflinching
spirit began to focus itself upon the young teacher of philosophy.
&ldquo;Resistance to praise,&rdquo; says the bitter La Rochefoucauld, &ldquo;is a
desire to be praised twice.&rdquo; And to so acute a student of human
nature as Loyola it soon grew evident that he was making progress.
This was proved even by the modesty of Xavier. Therefore he
redoubled his energies and utilized that marvellous power of
adaptation, which was his chief legacy to his order, in obtaining a
definite result. He gained ground so fast that Michael Navarro,
a faithful servant of the young scholar, became determined to
break off this dangerous fascination, and even attempted to kill
Loyola in his private apartments. But he, too, was dealing with
a brain which never relaxed its vigilance and with a magnetic personality
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
which felt a danger, and moved safely, cat-like, through
the dark. He was halted and challenged by the man he came to
kill, and being crushed down in confusion was thereupon treated
with magnanimity, and went away revolving many things in his
mind.</p>
<p>This was the power of Loyola&mdash;a power which sprang, first of
all, from his peculiar constitution, and, second, from his fanatical
ambition. It has been the key by which the Jesuit has ever since
unlocked the doors of palaces and contrived to whisper in the ears
of kings. Its extent has been that of the civilized and uncivilized
world. In the matter of organization no human fraternity has
ever equalled the Society of Jesus. The germs which we behold
at Ste. Barbe in Paris have grown into a tree whose roots have
taken hold on every soil, and whose fruit has dropped in every
clime. The order has invariably employed strategy, intrigue, ingenuity,
and perfect combination to secure its ends. It is, as a
system, far from being either dead or insignificant. And its real
vitality has always sprung from its maxim that its associated members,
vowed to celibacy and to the accomplishment of its purposes,
should be <i>Perinde ac si cadavera</i>&mdash;absolutely subordinate and dead
to any other will&mdash;in the hands of the &ldquo;general&rdquo; who is at the head
of its affairs. It has worked, first for itself, second for the Roman
Catholic Church, and third for the proselytizing of the heathen and
the heretics. It has never neglected to procure in every manner
the information it needed to the full extent or to employ its principle
that the end to be gained justifies the means that are taken to gain it.
Thus it is the legitimate outgrowth of the soldier-courtier-fanatic
mind of its founder. And this was the mind which
was now spending its splendid resources upon Xavier, playing
with him like a trout upon the hook, until it should land him, a
completely surrendered man, within its own control.</p>
<p>In another sphere and under other influences, Xavier might have
been a far different person. He, at least, was sincere in his devotion
to the cause. He identified Jesuitism with Christianity and
Loyola with Jesus Himself. Hence his character and labors have
blinded many persons to the methods which he used and to the
results which he sought.</p>
<p>It must be sufficient for us that Ignatius Loyola had now gotten
the mastery of Francis Xavier so perfectly that he could be &ldquo;applied
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
to the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>, the furnace in which he [Loyola]
was accustomed to refine and purify his chosen vessels.&rdquo; A sister
of the future missionary had become one of the Barefooted Clares,
and had aided in dissuading her father from interference. And
now we behold Xavier praying with hands and feet tightly bound
by cords; or journeying with similar cords about his arms and the
calves of his legs until inflammation and ulceration ensued.
There were now nine of these converts, but this man outdid the
others in his austerities, and finally travelled on foot with them to
meet Loyola at Venice in 1537. The society had really been
formed on August 15th, 1534, at Montmartre near Paris, and this
was but its natural outward movement.</p>
<p>At Venice, on January 8th, 1537, they again met their leader
and were assigned for duty to the two hospitals of the city. That
of the &ldquo;Incurables&rdquo; fell to Xavier&rsquo;s share, and we read that with
the morbid devotion characteristic of a devout student of the
<i>Exercises</i>, he determined now to conquer his natural repugnance
to disease. In the course of his duties he had an unusually hideous
ulcer to dress for one of the patients. And the authentic history
relates that &ldquo;encouraging himself to the utmost, he stooped
down, kissed the pestilent cancer, licked it several times with his
tongue, and finally sucked out the virulent matter to the last
drop.&rdquo; (Bartoli and Maffei, p. 35.) There could be nothing
worse than that certainly. And a man who had resolutely sounded
this deepest abyss of self-abandonment was marked for the highest
honor that the new society could bestow. We cannot doubt
Xavier&rsquo;s sincerity, but the gigantic horror of this performance is of
a sort to place the man who has achieved it upon an eminence
apart from less daring minds. It was Loyola&rsquo;s way of facing
human nature and forcing it to concede the supreme self-devotion
of his followers. The world looks with amazement upon such
actions, but when it sees them, it yields a kind of stupefied allegiance
to those who have thus rushed beyond the bounds. And to
a close analysis there is as much concealed spiritual pride about
this nastiness as there is an unnecessary shock given to the sense
of decency. Thus, as Mozoomdar says, in his <i>Oriental Christ</i>,
&ldquo;Instead of abasing self, in many cases it serves the opposite
end.&rdquo; It &ldquo;imposes a sort of indebtedness upon Heaven&rdquo;
(p. 66). Yet the poor wretch who felt those lips upon his awful
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
wound could not but worship the frightful hero who plunged into
such nauseous contact with his loathsomeness.</p>
<p>Yes, this was and is the power of it all. It was and it is the
key-note of much that is potent with the world. When Victor
Hugo pictures Jean Valjean in the toils of the Thenardiers laying that
white, hot, hissing bar of iron upon his arm and calmly standing
before them while they shrink&mdash;ogres as they are&mdash;from the stench
and the sight, he merely uses this same element. Whatever, in
short, among us brings out the old savage nature; whatever
plunges outside of the conventionalities, the proprieties, or even the
common decencies of life; whatever defies the lightning, or dares
the volcano, or tramples upon the coiled serpent, that is the thing
which controls the world.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that this is not a Christian but a Jesuit act.
It is born of that exaggerated sentimentalism which chooses to go
beyond Christ and His apostles in its fallacious abnegation of self.
But wherever such acts are performed they rank as the marks of
saintship and as the <i>stigmata</i> of a crucifixion which proudly places
itself on the same Golgotha with another and nobler cross. The
records, not merely of Xavier&rsquo;s life, but of the lives of the saints,
swarm with these creeping, slimy frogs of Egypt, raised up by
enchanters of the human mind to make Pharaoh believe them to
be equal to a far higher Providence. And if we say little in these
pages about such strange developments and morbid growths of
piety, it need not be forgotten that they existed, and that they have
been fostered and encouraged by the Roman Church. The
Breviary, for instance, commends a roll of self-flagellators who
used the whip upon their naked backs, and Xavier heads the list
with his iron flail. Cardinal Damiani, who wrote one of our
loveliest hymns, introduced this fashion of scourging in 1056, and
the holy nun, St. Theresa, after such exercises and an additional
repose upon a bed of thorns, was &ldquo;accustomed to converse with
God.&rdquo; [<i>Aliquando inter spinas volutaret sic Deum alloqui solita.</i>]
This topic, with its allied suggestions, is altogether out of our present
scope; but in order to see Xavier as he was, we must appreciate
to what extent his spirit was subdued before his belief.</p>
<p>This was the man, tested and edged and tempered, to whom
was now committed the &ldquo;salvation of the Indies.&rdquo; It was during
the papacy of Paul III., the same Pope who excommunicated
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
Henry VIII. of England. And Xavier, who had practised many
austerities both in life and in behavior, was at first sent to Bologna,
while Loyola, with Faber and Laynez, went to Rome. It was subsequently
at Rome that Xavier had his famous vision, in which he
awoke crying, &ldquo;Yet more, O Lord, yet more!&rdquo; for he fancied
that&mdash;as the Apostle Paul once did&mdash;he had beheld his future
career and was glorying in trials and persecutions. Especially did
he often have a dream in which he seemed to be carrying an Indian
on his shoulders and toiling with him over the roughest and hardest
roads. And when at last Govea, the Rector of the College of
Ste. Barbe, happened to be in Rome, Ignatius and his companions
were brought by him to the notice of John III. of Portugal, and
the king desired to have six of them for use in India. The Pope
did not show any special desire to secure their services, and when
the question came up he referred it to Ignatius to decide it as he
pleased. That sagacious general objected to taking six from ten
and leaving only four to the rest of the world, for his ambition
now extended to the orb of the earth. He accordingly chose
Rodriguez and Bobadilla for India, men who were evidently well
selected, for the first became a great propagandist in Portugal, and
the other was a decided obstacle to the Reformation in Germany.
When Rodriguez, however, fell ill with an intermittent fever Xavier
naturally occurred to Loyola as the proper substitute. He therefore
commissioned him for the service, and the worn and wasted
ascetic patched up his old coat, said farewell to his friends, and
having craved the Pope&rsquo;s blessing, set off from Rome with the
Portuguese Ambassador, Mascarenhas, on March 16th, 1540.
He started in such poverty that Loyola took his own waistcoat and
put it upon him, and he left behind him a written paper of consecration
to the society, expressing in it his desire that Loyola should
be its head, with Faber as alternate, and in which he took the
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the order under whose
auspices he was going forth.</p>
<p>At the Portuguese Court in Lisbon, both Xavier and his companion
were diligent in their religious work. The morals of the
capital were quite reformed, and when it came time for the ships
to sail to the East the king would only spare Xavier and detained
Rodriguez, by the advice of Loyola, further to improve the affairs
at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>Xavier now sailed as Nuncio with papal commendation and with a
poverty of outfit which had its due effect upon his companions
on board the ship. The vessel itself was one of those great galleons
of Spanish or Portuguese origin, carrying often a thousand
persons, and having from four to seven decks. They were huge,
unwieldy constructions and were generally freighted with large
amounts of rich merchandise. The course was that pursued by
Vasco da Gama&mdash;around the Cape of Good Hope and into the
Indian Ocean&mdash;and the voyage often lasted beyond eight months.
It is quaintly related of travellers by these precarious sea-paths that
they used to take their shrouds and winding-sheets with them in
case they died by the way.</p>
<p>The company on shipboard was as bad as the provisions, which
were often execrable. The peninsular sailors never had the art
either of discipline or of storing a ship and supplying what was
needful for a voyage, as the English sea-kings had it. Hence their
vessels were great floating caravansaries of human beings, full of
the scum and offscouring of society&mdash;with lords and ladies on the
quarter-deck, and robbers and murderers, harlots and gamblers
down below. The crew was as prompt as that of Jonah&rsquo;s ship to
cry upon their gods whenever the wind blew. Such inventions as
the ship&rsquo;s pump, the chain-cable, and the bowsprit were not known
to them. And when we see Sir Richard Grenville in the little
Revenge fighting fifteen great Dons for as many hours, or Sir John
Hawkins beating his way out of the harbor of Vera Cruz when the
<i>Jesus</i> of Lubec was lost by Spanish treachery, we see how utterly
cumbrous and awkward these galleons were when compared with
English vessels.</p>
<p>Sickness also, in the form of fevers and scurvy, was very frequent.
And there was such laxity of discipline that a six months&rsquo;
voyage generally turned the great hulk into a hell of misery and
riot. Here, therefore, Xavier was in his element. He slept on
the deck; he begged his own bread, and the delicacies pressed
upon him by the captain he divided among the neediest of the
poor sufferers; he invented games to amuse those who were inclined
toward amusement; and by degrees he commingled his sympathy
and friendly offices with the necessities of the crew and passengers
until they called him the &ldquo;holy father.&rdquo; He constantly
preached, taught, and labored in this manner until he finally succumbed
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
to an epidemic fever which broke out when they were not
far from Mozambique. Here he was landed and for a time was
in hospital, at length completing his voyage to India in a different
ship from that in which he had first embarked.</p>
<p>Scattered through his story, both then and afterward, we have
accounts of various miracles, of his exhibition of a spirit of
prophecy, and eventually of his raising the dead. These demand
a moment&rsquo;s consideration. He is said, for instance, to have predicted
the loss of the <i>San Jago</i>, in which he sailed from Portugal
and which was wrecked after he left her. He did the same with
one or two other vessels and assured several persons of their own
impending death or misfortune. Sometimes he was observed to
speak as though he were holding conversation with unseen companions,
and he was apparently conscious of events which were
afterward found to have occurred at the very time in distant places.
There is also a series of phenomena connected with the &ldquo;gift of
tongues&rdquo; in his case, by which this power appears to have been
intermittent, or at least dependent to a great degree upon a remarkable
intensity of scholarship and keenness of analysis combined
with a powerful memory. It is not claimed that he exercised
this gift in such a manner as &ldquo;to converse in a foreign tongue the
moment he landed in this foreign country.&rdquo; And then there is a
further class of remarkable experiences connected with fevers and
diseases and the raising of the dead.</p>
<p>Of these latter miracles it may be well to treat first. He is said
to have raised up Anthony Miranda, an Indian, who had been
bitten by a cobra; to have restored four dead persons at Travancore;
to have resuscitated a young girl in Japan and a child in
Malacca, and to have actually brought to the ship, alive and well,
a lad who had fallen overboard and been apparently lost. These
incidents are related with great gravity by the biographers and are
accepted by the faithful as being strictly true. To impugn them
is as if one impugned the Scriptures. Nevertheless there is an
opening for scepticism in sundry cases, and it may be that we
shall do well to agree with the saint&rsquo;s own statement made to
Doctor Diego Borba. &ldquo;Ah, my Jesus!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;can it
be said that such a wretch as I have been able to raise the dead?
Surely, my dear Diego, you have not believed such folly? They
brought a young man to me whom they supposed to be dead; I
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
commanded him to arise, and the common people, who make a
miracle of everything, gave out the report that a dead man had
been raised to life.&rdquo; For the rest, we may well believe that the
same exaggeration and lack of scientific attention to details have
accompanied the various accounts, in some such manner as appears
in the little sketch of his personal characteristics which a young
Coquimban named Vaz has given to us. This enthusiastic admirer
describes his going afoot with a patched and faded garment
and an old black cloth hat. He took nothing from the rich or
great unless he applied it to the uses of the poor. He spoke languages
fluently without having learned them, and the crowds which
flocked to hear him often amounted to five or six thousand persons.
He celebrated Mass in the open air and preached from the
branches of a tree when he had no other pulpit. But of this healing
of the sick and raising of the dead we are not offered any
better testimonials than the &ldquo;Acts of his Canonization.&rdquo; Moreover,
in a manner quite contrary to the experiences recorded in
the Gospels, these various miracles seem to be looked upon as the
decisive stroke of Christian policy. Upon their occurrence tribes
and kingdoms bow before the truth&mdash;a thing which did not happen
at the tomb of Lazarus, or before the walls of Nain, or within the
house of Jairus. In those cases the evangelists are content to tell
us that the influence was limited and confined to a very moderate
area.</p>
<p>Yet when we come to the cures of sick people, to the singular
predictions, and to the exalted condition into which Xavier must
often have been lifted, we must allow to the man a very high degree
of mystical and mesmeric and even clairvoyant power. We
are wise enough nowadays to observe the influence of a devoted
personality, as when Florence Nightingale traverses the hospital
wards at Scutari, or David Livingstone moves through savage
tribes, to his dying hour at Lake Lincoln. And when profound
Church historians will not altogether discredit the miracles of the
Nicene Age which Ambrose and Augustine relate, it causes us to
be charitable even toward the miracles of Bernard of Clairvaux,
who recorded at large his own sense of uneasiness respecting his
power of curing the sick. But it somewhat relieves the mind
when the very chapters which relate these experiences of St. Francis
Xavier, mention also that a crab came out of the sea and brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
him his lost crucifix, and that after he had lived in a certain house
two children and a woman fell out of the window at different times
and received not so much as a single bruise, though they dropped
from an immense height upon the sea-wall. The credulity which
includes such palpable absurdities must surely have exposed itself
to misstatements and exaggerations in other directions.</p>
<p>It is far pleasanter for us to follow Xavier from his arrival at
Goa, May 6th, 1542, to the fisheries of Cape Comorin; thence to
Malacca, and so to the Banda Islands, Amboyna, and the Moluccas
in 1546; again to Malacca in 1547; to Ceylon and back to
Goa in 1548, and finally to Japan. In 1551 he planned a visit to
China, but was disappointed, and at the moment when he was
hoping to accomplish a great purpose he died on the island of
San Chan, December 22d, 1552, at the early age of forty-six years.</p>
<p>Closely studying himself and his methods we find him greatly
and always devout, his breviary, however, being his Bible. He
prayed much and labored incessantly. His charity to small and
great was untiring. He would go through the streets ringing a
little bell and calling people to come to religious worship, being
frequently attended by a throng of children who seem to have
loved him and been beloved by him. He had noble and sweet
and modest traits in his character. But we often notice the reliance
he places on baptism&mdash;sometimes conferring this rite until his arm
dropped from weariness. And we observe how much of the wisdom
of the serpent can be discerned in his ways with the people
whom he desired to secure.</p>
<p>The indefatigable exertions of Xavier are above all praise. He
never appears to have slackened in his zeal, nor does he ever show
hesitation, doubt, or uncertainty of any kind. On one occasion
when roused by a great crisis he displayed a military authority
worthy of Loyola himself. He stood once in front of an invading
host of Badages and forbade them to attack the Paravans, shouting
to them, &ldquo;In the name of the living God I command you to return
whence you came.&rdquo; No wonder that the semi-barbarous
people were affected by this fearless and singular presence, and
spoke of Xavier as a person of gigantic stature dressed in black
and whose flashing eyes dazzled and daunted them.</p>
<p>But upon other occasions he was gentle and amenable to every
agreeable trait in his companions. He could even take the cards
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
from a broken gamester, shuffle them to give him good fortune,
and send him back to try his luck with fifty reals borrowed from
another passenger. The man&rsquo;s success is thereupon made a basis
for his penitence. And so with the wicked cavalier of Meliapore,
whose friendship he gained by being unconscious of his vices until
the time for exhortation arrived. In these and similar instances
we cannot fail to observe a thorough knowledge of human nature,
and a Jesuit&rsquo;s keen power of using it for his own purposes.</p>
<p>He was not always prospered in his enterprises. Once at least
he literally shook off the dust from his shoes against an offending
tribe. At another time he was wounded by an arrow. But, as a
rule, he had a complete moral victory in whatever he undertook.
In one of his letters he speaks of the people being maliciously disposed
and ready to poison both food and drink. But he will take
no antidotes with him, and is determined to avoid all human
remedies whatsoever. It is in such superb examples of his absolute
trust in God that he presents to us the really grand side of his
character. He did not know what fear was, and as for death, he
was too familiar with daily dying to be concerned at it. His personal
faith was such as to beget faith in others, as when an earthquake
interrupted his preaching upon St. Michael&rsquo;s Day, and he
announced that the archangel was then driving the devils of that
unhappy country back to the pit. This was said so earnestly as
to produce a profound conviction of its truth and to remove all
alarm from his audience.</p>
<p>But when we are asked to believe that the two Pereiras ever
beheld him elevated from the earth and actually transfigured, or
when it is stated that he lifted a great beam as though it had been
a lath, we must be excused for being doubtful of the statement.
There is nothing more destructive of religion than superstition,
and nothing which kills faith like credulity. Xavier, with all his
false notions, was a most sincere and even majestic figure&mdash;a hero
of the faith, who shows us the power of a thoroughly devoted spirit
unencumbered by any earthly tie and unobstructed by any earthly
want. The entire self-immolation of this career constitutes its
amazing power. It is the missionary spirit carried to its loftiest
height.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of his most ingenious ways to secure the good-will
of his companions was by endeavoring to excite their benevolence.
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
He would encourage them to little acts of kindness and would
repay these by similar favors and services. Particularly he used
persuasion rather than denunciation, and personal efforts rather
than general harangues. He was &ldquo;all things to all men,&rdquo; going
&ldquo;privately to those of reputation,&rdquo; as Paul, his great model, was
wont to do. He once wrote: &ldquo;It is better to do a little with
peace than a great deal with turbulence and scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On April 14th, 1552, he set sail from Goa for Malacca where a
pestilence was raging. This delayed him awhile from China, and
he was held back still longer by the envious quarrellings of those
who aspired to the honor of attending him on his voyage. Xavier
was reduced to the necessity of producing the papal authority
which constituted him Nuncio, and of threatening with excommunication
Don Alvaro Ata&iuml;de, the most troublesome person. In
addition to this difficulty he found himself insulted and reviled in
the open street, but accepted everything with meekness and
patience; which, however, did not prevent his finally excommunicating
Ata&iuml;de in the regular form. The vessel on which he embarked
was manned mostly by those in the pay of Ata&iuml;de, but he
did not shrink from the voyage. The voyage itself is decorated
with many legends, as might be expected. The saint is reported
to have changed salt water into fresh; to have rescued a child
from death in a miraculous manner, and to have become suddenly
so much taller and larger than those about him as to have been
compelled to lower his arms when he baptized the converts.
They sailed from Chinchoo to San Chan, an island in which the
Portuguese had some trading privileges. It was here that Xavier
uttered a prediction which may serve to explain other singular
occurrences. He would seem to have possessed more than an
ordinary amount of medical skill in diagnosis, and looking earnestly
upon an old friend named Vellio, he bade him prepare for
death whenever the wine he drank <i>tasted bitter</i>. This might easily
be from either of two causes&mdash;poison, or a disorganized state of the
system. And it is recorded that the result fulfilled the prophecy.
Nor is there much doubt that Vellio&rsquo;s entire faith in the prediction
helped on his death.</p>
<p>From San Chan Xavier now proposed to cross to China. He
arranged to be smuggled thither in a small boat, but the residents
of San Chan, English as well as Portuguese, became alarmed at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
consequences which they foresaw from this desperate scheme of
intrusion into the forbidden empire. And to crown all his woes
he fell sick with a fever, from which, however, he convalesced in
a fortnight. He was now more anxious than ever to go on with
his project. But all the Portuguese ships had sailed back again
except the Santa Cruz, on which he had arrived. And now he
was truly deserted and neglected. He had scarcely the bare necessaries
of life, sometimes being deprived entirely of food. The
sailors were mostly in Ata&iuml;de&rsquo;s pay and inimical to his purpose.
At length he became convinced that he would himself soon die,
and so would often walk in meditation and prayer by the seashore
gazing toward the prohibited coast.</p>
<p>At this time the young Chinese Anthony was his only hope as
an interpreter; and he was now deprived of the services of the
merchant and his son who had agreed to row him over to Canton.
They had deserted him, and only Anthony and one more young
lad remained true to the dying missionary. On November 20th
the fever again seized him after he had celebrated Mass. He was
taken to a floating hospital, but being disturbed by its motion he
begged to be landed. This was done and he was left upon the
beach in the bleak wind. A poor Portuguese named George
Alvarez then took pity on him and removed him to his own hut
of boughs and straw. Rude medical care was given him, but on
December 2d, about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, he had reached
the limit of his life. His latest words were, <i>In te, Domine, speravi&mdash;non
confundar in aeternum</i>&mdash;O Lord, I have trusted in Thee, I
shall never be confounded, world without end.</p>
<p>Thus died Francis Xavier, for ten years and seven months a
missionary in the most dangerous and deadly regions of the earth.
At the date of his death he was of full and robust figure in spite of
his privations, with eyes of a bluish-gray, and hair that had changed
its dark chestnut color somewhat through his toils and sufferings.
His forehead was broad, his nose good, and his expression pleasant
and affable. His beard, like his hair, was thick, and his temperament
was nearly a pure sanguine.</p>
<p>They buried him first at San Chan, then removed him to Goa,
where in solemn procession they conducted his mortal body to its
final rest. But his right arm was taken off and it is to be observed
that &ldquo;the saint seems not to have been pleased at the amputation
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
of his arm,&rdquo; which, however, did not prevent the Jesuit, General
Claude Acquaviva, from insisting upon the mutilation.</p>
<p>Down to the present time his memory has received many honors.
Churches have been erected, prayers have been offered, and
much religious worship has been transacted in his name. But to
us who are looking upon him from another angle altogether, there
are apparent in him a piety, a zeal, a courage, and a &ldquo;hot-hearted
prudence&rdquo; (to quote F. W. Faber&rsquo;s words) which arouse our admiration.
And in the two hymns which bear his name we are
able to discover that fine attar which is the precious residuum of
many crushed and fragrant aspirations, which grew above the
thorns of sharp trial and were strewn at last upon the wind-swept
beach of that poor Pisgah island from which he truly beheld the
distant Land.</p>

<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE HYMN-WRITERS OF THE BREVIARY.</span></h2>
<p>There are three principal liturgical books in use in the Roman
Catholic Church. Originally there were two: the Ritual, which
contained all the sacramental offices, and the Breviary, which contained
the rest. But for convenience the eucharistic office in its
various forms now has a book to itself called the Missal, and the
other six sacraments recognized in the Church of Rome make up
the Ritual.</p>
<p>It is with the Breviary, however, that hymnology is especially
concerned, as it is in it that the hymns of the Church are mostly to
be found, while the sequences belong to the Missal. It contains
the prayers said in the Church&rsquo;s behalf every day at the canonical
hours by the priests and the members of the religious orders.
Originally there were only three of these canonical hours, and
they were based on Old Testament usage. These were at the
third, sixth, and ninth hour of the Scriptures (nine o&rsquo;clock, noon,
and three in the afternoon), and in the Western Church are called
Tierce, Sext, and Nones, for that reason. The number afterward
was increased to five and then to seven. To these three day hours
were added three night hours, with two at the transition from night
to day (Prime), and from day to night (Vespers). But to get up
thrice in the night was too much for even monastic discipline,
so they said two night services together at midnight, and then
they slept till dawn. As this daily service differs in its contents
according to the seasons of the Church year, and also is adapted
to the commemoration of the saints of the Calendar, the Breviary
is the most voluminous prayer-book known to Christendom. It
generally is published in four substantial volumes, one each for
the four natural seasons. It is used in such public services as are
not accompanied by a celebration of any sacrament and in the
choir service of the religious houses. In theory, however, the
Church is present even at the solitary recitation of the hours by a
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
secular priest; and when two say them in company they must
say them aloud.</p>
<p>Hymns were not in the services of the Breviary from the beginning.
As late as the sixth century there was a controversy as
to admitting anything but the words of Scripture to be sung.
We find a Gallic synod sanctioning their use, and a Spanish synod
taking common ground with our Psalm-singing Presbyterians.
But in the next century even Spain, through the Council of Toledo
(<span class="small">A.D.</span> 633), appeals to early precedent in behalf of hymns,
and decides that if people may use uninspired words in prayer, they may
do the same in their praises&mdash;<i>Sicut ergo orationes, ita et hymnos in
laudem Dei compositos nullus vestrum ulterius improbet</i>&mdash;which went
to the core of the question and silenced the exclusive Psalm-singers.
Twenty years later another Council of Toledo required of candidates
for orders that they should know both the Psalter and the
hymns by heart. Yet in the Roman Breviary no hymns were introduced
before the thirteenth century, when Haymo, the General
of the Franciscan Order, reformed it in 1244 with the sanction of
Gregory IX. and Nicholas III.</p>
<p>In the view of Roman Catholic liturgists, the Psalms set forth
the praise of God in general, while hymns are written and used
with reference to some single mystery of the faith, or the commemoration
of some saint. This harmonizes with their use in the
Breviary, and their division into hymns <i>de tempore</i> for the festivals
of the Church year, or the days of the week, or the hours of the
day; and hymns <i>de sanctis</i> for the days of commemoration in the
Church Calendar. Even when the same hymn is used on a series
of days, its conclusion is altered to give it a special adaptation to
each of these days. This classification, of course, does not describe
the whole body of the Latin hymns. Some few even of
those in the Breviary, as, for instance, the <i>Te Deum</i>, have to be
classed as psalms, and are called Canticles (<i>Cantica</i>); and many
outside it will not fit into any such definition of what a hymn is.
But it illustrates the general character and purpose of the hymns
of the Roman and other breviaries, as designed for a special temporal
or personal application by way of supplement to the Psalter.</p>
<p>At present the Roman Breviary, prepared with the sanction of
the Council of Trent, has driven nearly all the others out of use.
But at the era of the Reformation there was a great number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
breviaries, every diocese and religious order having a right to its
own. Panzer enumerates no less than seventy-one which were
printed before 1536, some of them in several
editions.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
Even now the Roman Breviary is supplemented by special services in
honor of the saints of each order or country, and by services of a
more general kind which are peculiar to some localities. But in
Luther&rsquo;s time the endless variety in breviaries and missals formed
a striking feature of the confusion which to his mind characterized
the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>With the development of a more fastidious taste, through the
study of the Latin classics as literary models, there arose in the
sixteenth century, and even before the Reformation, a demand
for a reformation of the Breviary. Besides its defects of form,
such as violations of Latin grammar, the constant use of terms
which grated on the ears of the humanists, and the use of hymns
in which rhyme rather added to the offence of want of correct
metre, the contents of the Breviary were found faulty by a critical
age. The selections from the Fathers to be read by way of homily
were in some cases from spurious works; and the narratives of
saints&rsquo; lives for the days dedicated to them were not always edifying,
and in some cases palpably untrue. It became a proverbial
saying that a person lied like the second nocturn office of the
Breviary, that being the service in which these legends are found.
But the badness of the Latin and the metrical faults of the hymns
counted for quite as much with the critics of that day. We hear
of a cardinal warning a young cleric not to be too constant in
reading his Breviary, if he wished to preserve his ear for correct
Latinity.</p>
<p>As might have been expected, it was the elegant Medicean Pope
Leo X. who first put his hand to the work of reform. He selected
for this purpose Zacharia Ferreri, Bishop of Guarda-Alfieri, a man
of fine Latin scholarship and some ability as a poet. By 1525 Ferreri
had the hymns for a new Breviary ready, and published them
with the promise of the Breviary itself on the title-page.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
Clement VII., also of the house of Medici, was Pope when the book appeared,
and he authorized the substitution of these new hymns
for the old, but did not command this.</p>
<p>The book is furnished with an introduction by Marino Becichemi,
a forgotten humanist, who was then professor of eloquence
at Padua. It is worth quoting as exhibiting the attitude of the
Renaissance to the earlier Christian literature. He praises Ferreri
as a shining light in every kind of science, human and divine,
prosaic and poetical. He cannot say too much of the beauty of
his style, its gravity and dignity, its purity, its spontaneity and
freedom from artificiality. &ldquo;That his hymns and odes, beyond
all doubt, will secure him immortality, I need not conceal. Certainly
I have read nothing in Christian poets sweeter, purer, terser,
or brighter. How brief and how copious, each in its place&mdash;how
polished! Everywhere the stream flows in full channel with that
antique Roman mode of speech, except where of full purpose it
turns in another direction.&rdquo; That means how Ciceronian Ferreri&rsquo;s
speech, except where he remembers that he is a Christian poet and
bishop writing for Christian worshippers. &ldquo;More than once have
I exhorted him that it belonged to the duty and dignity of his episcopal
(<i>pontificii</i>) office to make public these Church hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my reader, what hymns they sing everywhere in
the temples, that they are almost all faulty, silly, full of barbarism,
and composed without reference to the number of feet or the
quantity of the syllables, so as to excite educated persons to laughter,
and to bring priests, if they are men of letters, to despise the services
of the Church. I say men of letters. As for those who are
not, and who are the gluttons of the Roman curia, or who have
no wisdom, it is enough for them to stand like dragons close by
the sacred ark, or to drift about like the clouds, to live like idle
bellies, given over to the pursuit of sleep, good living, sensual
pleasures, and to gather up the money by which they make themselves
hucksters in religion and plunderers of the Christian people
and practice their deceits upon both gods and men equally, until the
vine of the Lord degenerates into a wild plant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>The Italianized Greek would see no difference between a Tetzel
and a Ferreri. But there still were sincerely good people who
relished the old hymns better than the polished paganism of the
Bishop of Guarda-Alfieri. Ferreri&rsquo;s hymns struck no root in spite
of the favor of two Medicean popes. They seem never to have
reached a second edition. Their frankly pagan vocabulary for the
expression of Christian ideas seems to have been too much for
even the humanists.</p>
<p>Bishop Ferreri does not seem to have lived to prepare his shorter
and easier Breviary after the same elegant but unsuitable fashion
as his hymns. So Clement VII. put the preparation of a new
Breviary into the hands of another and a better man, Cardinal
Francesco de Qui&ntilde;onez. He was a Spanish Franciscan, had been
general of his order, and was made Cardinal by Clement in acknowledgment
of diplomatic services. He enjoyed the confidence
of the Emperor Charles V., and used it to rescue the Pope from his
detention in the Castle of San Angelo, when he was besieged there
after the taking of Rome by the Imperial troops in 1529. This is
hardly the kind of record which would lead us to look for a reformer
under the red hat of our cardinal. But, so far as the
Breviary was concerned, he proved himself too rigorous a reformer,
if anything. His work was governed by two leading principles.
The first was to simplify the services by dropping out
those parts which had been added last. The second was to use
the space thus obtained to insert ampler Scripture lessons and
more Psalms, so that, as in earlier times, the Bible might be read
through once a year and the Psalter once a week. It is this last
feature which has elicited the praise of Protestant liturgists, and it
is known that the Breviary of Qui&ntilde;onez furnished the basis for the
services of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, excepting, of
course, the Communion Service. But unfortunately hymnologists
are not able to join in this praise. To get the Psalms said or sung
through once a week, he dealt nearly as ruthlessly with the hymns
as if he were a Seceder.</p>
<p>His Breviary appeared in 1535,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>
and for thirty-three years its
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
use was permitted to ecclesiastics in their private recitation of the
hours. It appeared in a large number of editions in different
parts of Europe, so that its use must have been extensive. But
it did not pass unchallenged. The doctors of the Sorbonne at
Paris hurried into the arena with their condemnation of it before
the ink was fully dry on the first copies. They declared it a thing
unheard of to introduce into Church use a book which was the
production of a single author, and he&mdash;as they wrongly alleged&mdash;not
even a member of any religious order. Furthermore, he had
so shortened and eviscerated the legends for the saints&rsquo; days,
besides omitting many, that nobody could tell what virtues and
what miracles entitled them to commemoration. Above all he
had omitted Peter Damiani&rsquo;s Little Office of the Blessed Virgin!
Much better founded was the objection to the omission of parts
long established in use, such as the antiphons and many of
the hymns. Here we must side with the Sorbonne against
Qui&ntilde;onez.</p>
<p>It was not until 1568 that the present Roman Breviary appeared.
When the Council of Trent met in its final session in
1562, the first drafts of a reformed Breviary and Missal were
transmitted to the Fathers by Pius IV.; but they were too busy
with questions of discipline to do more than return these with
their approbation. The work was published by Pius V. in July,
1568, and its use was made obligatory upon all dioceses which
had not had a Breviary of their own in use for two hundred years
previously. This is in substance the Breviary now in use throughout
the Roman Catholic Church. It underwent, however, two
further revisions. That under Clement VIII., finished in 1602,
was by a commission in which Cardinals Bellarmine, Baronius,
and Silvius Antonianus were members. That under Urban VIII.,
completed in 1631, concerns us more directly, and especially the
part of it which was effected by three learned Jesuits: Famiano
Strada, Hieronimo Petrucci, and Tarquinio Galucci, who had in
their hands the revision of the hymns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>The three revisers, all of them poets of some distinction, and
the first famous for his history of the wars in the Low Countries,
had to steer a middle course in the matter of revision. None of
them were radical humanists after the fashion of Zacharia Ferreri;
that fashion, indeed, had gone out with the rise of the counter-reformation
and of the great order to which they belonged. Yet
in the matter of &ldquo;metre and Latinity,&rdquo; of which Ferreri boasted
on his title page a hundred years before, the revival of classical
scholarship had established a standard to which the old hymns
even of the Ambrosian period did not conform. The revisers
profess their anxiety to make as few changes as possible; but
Pope Urban, in his bull <i>Psalmodiam sanctam</i> prefixed to the book,
announces that all the hymns&mdash;except the very few which made
no pretension to metrical form&mdash;had been conformed to the laws
of prosody and of the Latin tongue, those which could not be
amended in any milder way being rewritten throughout. Bartolomeo
Gavanti, a member of the Commission of Revision, but
laboring in another department, tells us that more than nine hundred
alterations were made for the sake of correct metre, with the
result of changing the first lines of more than thirty of the ninety-six
hymns the Breviary then contained; that the three by Aquinas
on the sacrament, the <i>Ave Maris stella</i>, the <i>Custodes hominum</i>, and
a very few others, were left as they were.</p>
<p>This, then, is the genesis of the class of hymns designated in
the collections as traceable no farther back than the Roman
Breviary. Some of them are original, being the work of Silvius
Antonianus, Bellarmine, or Urban VIII. himself, or of authors of
that age whose authorship has not been traced. But the greater
part are recasts of ancient hymns to meet the demands of the
humanist standards of metre and Latinity.</p>
<p>It is not easy to give a merely English reader any adequate
idea of the sort of changes by which Strada and his associates
adapted the old hymns to modern use. But for those who can
read Latin some specimens are worth giving. Take first the
great sacramental hymn of the eighth or ninth century:</p>

<p>Now it is impossible to deny to the revised version merits of its
own. Not only does it use the Latin words which classic usage
requires&mdash;as <i>dapes</i> in poetry for <i>coena</i>, <i>recepta</i> for <i>reddita</i>, <i>inferis</i>
for <i>barathro</i>&mdash;but it brings into clearer view the facts of the Old
Testament story which the hymn treats as typical of the Christian
passover. The (imperfect) rhyme of the original is everywhere
sacrificed to the demands of metre, which probably is no loss.
But the gain is not in simplicity, vigor, and freshness. In these
the old hymn is much superior. The last verse but one, for instance,
presents in the old hymn a distinct and living picture&mdash;the
picture Luther tells us he delighted in when a boy chorister singing
the Easter songs of the Church. But in the recast the vividness
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
is blurred, and classic reminiscence takes the place of the
simple and direct speech the early Church made for itself out of
the Latin tongue.</p>
<p>Take again the first part of the dedication hymn, of which
<i>Angulare fundamentum</i> is the conclusion:</p>

<p>Daniel in his first volume prints fifty-five of these recasts in
parallel columns with the originals, and to that we will refer our
readers for further specimens. It is gratifying to know that not
all the scholarship of that age was insensible to the qualities which
the revisers sacrificed. Henry Valesius, although only a layman
and a lover of good Latin&mdash;as his versions of the historians of the
early Church show&mdash;uttered a fierce but ineffectual protest in
favor of the early and mediaeval hymns. And the Marquis of
Bute, a convert to Catholicism, who published an English translation
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
of the Breviary in 1879, says that the revisers of 1602 &ldquo;with
deplorable taste made a series of changes in the texts of the
hymns, which has been disastrous both to the literary merit and
the historical interest of the poems.&rdquo; He hopes for a further revision
which shall undo this mischief, but in other respects return
to the type furnished by the Breviary of Qui&ntilde;onez.</p>
<p>The translations from the hymns of the Roman Breviary have
been very abundant. Those by Protestants have been due to the
fact that the texts even of ancient hymns were so much more accessible
in their Breviary version than in their original form.
Among Roman Catholics, of course, other considerations have
weight; and in Mr. Edward Caswall&rsquo;s <i>Lyra Catholica</i> and Mr. Orby
Shipley&rsquo;s <i>Annus Sanctus</i> will be found some very admirable versions.
The latter book is an anthology from the Roman Catholic
translators from John Dryden to John Henry Newman.</p>
<p>From the Breviary text Mr. Duffield has made the following
translations of two hymns by Gregory the Great:</p>
<h3>JAM LUCIS ORTO SIDERE.</h3>

<p>While we have to treat rather of hymns than of hymn-writers in
dealing with the Roman Breviary, there is much of personal interest
attaching to the Breviary of Paris, its great rival in hymnological
interest. A slight revision of the hymns of this Breviary was
effected in 1527&mdash;of which the <i>Urbs Jerusalem beata</i> is a type&mdash;and
only with the idea of correcting corruptions of the text. But
the Roman revision of 1568-1631 affected the Gallican Church&rsquo;s
services very slightly. In no part of the Roman Catholic world
were the rights of the national Church guarded so carefully as in
France, until Napoleon bargained them away by the Concordat
of 1801. The French bishops and monastic orders continued to
retain their old service-books long after uniformity had been
established, under plea of unity, in other parts of the Church;
and they made such alterations in them as they thought necessary
to the edification of their people.</p>
<p>It was the Order of Cluny which first took steps toward the
substitution of new hymns for those whose use had been sanctioned
by long tradition. The general chapter of that branch of
the great Benedictine family in 1676-78 charged Paul Rabusson
and Claude de Vert with the preparation of a new Breviary. On
Rabusson, who was teaching theology in the monastery of St.
Martin des Champs in Paris, the labor chiefly fell. He applied
to Claude Santeul, a pensioner of the ecclesiastical seminary attached
to the Abbey of St. Magloire, asking him to prepare the
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
new hymns. Claude Santeul (<i>Santolius Maglorianus</i>) agreed to
do so, and made some progress in the work. He finished six
hymns, which were inserted in the new Breviary, and at his death
(1684) he left two manuscript volumes of unfinished hymns
among his papers. But he found that his being selected had excited
the jealousy of his younger brother, Jean Santeul, a canon of
the monastery of St. Victor (<i>Santolius Victorinus</i>), who already
was recognized as the finest, but by no means the most edifying of
the Latin poets of the France of his time.</p>
<p>Claude gladly gave place to his brother&mdash;who was accepted by
the Cluny Fathers&mdash;in the hope that the work of writing hymns
would divert him from the pagan poetizing, which was regarded
as unbecoming to his cloth. Jean Santeul is the oddest figure in
the annals of Latin hymnology, which is saying a good deal. He
is &ldquo;a man of whom it is hard to speak without falling into caricature,&rdquo;
Sainte-Beuve says (<i>Causeries de Lundi</i>, XII., 20-56). He
combined the talent of a poet of nature&rsquo;s making with the simplicity
of a child and the vanity and wit of a genuine Frenchman.
He recalls La Fontaine by many of his traits, and, under the name
of &ldquo;Theodas,&rdquo; he has furnished La Bruy&egrave;re with the materials
for one of the cleverest portraits in the <i>Caract&egrave;res</i> (1687). His
mode of life was a scandal to De Rance and other severe Churchmen,
who were laboring for the restoration of strict monastic discipline.
His love of good living and the charm of his society and
his talk carried him off from his monastery and his hours, sometimes
for weeks together. His Latin inscriptions, which adorned
the fountains, bridges, and public monuments of Paris, at once
gave him recognition as the poet laureate and pensioner of the
<i>grande monarque</i>, and as a priest whose poetry dealt more in the
pagan deities than in any distinctively Christian references. He
was not an immoral man in any gross sense. Even as a <i>bon
vivant</i>, he does not seem to have transgressed what were recognized
as the bounds of sobriety, and his poetry is as free as was his life
from licentiousness. But he was frivolous, gay, reckless, and as
worldly as was consistent with his being a grown-up child. Everybody,
even severe and silent De Rance at La Trappe, liked him,
but everybody shook his head over the inconsistency of his life
with his monastic vocation, and none more sorrowfully than his
good brother Claude at St. Magloire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
<p>Now at last there seemed to be the opportunity to reclaim him
by occupying his mind and his art with serious subjects, and by
bringing him into edifying associations with good men. That he
was not enough of a theologian to discharge the task satisfactorily
of himself, was rather an advantage from this point of view. The
eloquent and learned Jansenist, Nicolas le Tourneux, undertook
the work of coaching him. The partnership worked reasonably
well. Of course hymns produced by this kind of division of labor,
in which one took care of the sense and another of the expression,
have the defects of their method. But Le Tourneux was as careful
of the poet as of his verse. His severe eye detected the play
of Santeul&rsquo;s vanity even in the work of writing hymns. &ldquo;Reflect,
my dear brother,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;that while in the visible and militant
Church one may sing the praises of God with an impure heart
and defiled lips, it will not be so in heaven. You have burnt
incense in your verse, but there was strange fire in the censer.
Vanity furnishes your motive where it ought to be charity.&rdquo; He
objects to Santeul&rsquo;s calling himself &ldquo;the poet of Jesus Christ,&rdquo;
while he admits that vain glory leads him to write hymns. &ldquo;If
you and I were all we ought to be,&rdquo; wrote the severe Jansenist,
&ldquo;we would quake with fear at having dared, you to sing and I to
preach of the holiness of God, without a right sense of it. We
shall be only too happy if He pardon our sermons and our verses.&rdquo;
Perhaps the severity was needed and did good.</p>
<p>So Le Tourneux suggested and all but wrote the prayer in
which Santeul dedicated his hymns to our Lord: &ldquo;Receive what
is Thine; forgive what is mine. Thine is whatever I have uttered
that is good and holy. Mine that I have handled Thy good
things unworthily, and not from desire to please Thee, but from
an undue pride of poetry, of which I am ashamed. Thou hast
given me songs to praise Thee. Give me prayers, give me tears
to wash away the stains of a life less than Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hymns must have circulated in manuscript before their
publication, for we find De Rance in 1683 praising those in commemoration
of St. Bernard, while noticing that the old hymns, if
less excellent as literature, had a more reverential spirit. In 1685,
a year in advance of the new Breviary, Santeul published them in
the first collection he made of them.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> Their merits made a much
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
deeper impression than their defects. Scholars and Churchmen
alike were struck by their rhetorical vigor, the frequent boldness
of their conception, the beautiful succession of sentiments and
images, the exquisite clearness of the sense, and not by the factitious
character of their enthusiasm, as Sainte-Beuve puts it, or the
frequent monotony in the treatment of cognate themes. The
Breviary, in fact, had ceased to be the voice of the Christian congregation.
The supersession of Latin by the national languages
of Western Europe had made it the prayer-book of a class educated
to relish only the classic forms of Latin verse, and to regard
the simplicity of the early hymn-writers as barbarous. Santeul
wrote for priests whose tastes had been formed on Horace and
Virgil, and he brought into these rigid forms as much of genuine
Christian feeling and doctrine as the age required. He was all
the happier in these respects, as Le Tourneux, who himself contributed
to the new Breviary, was of that Jansenist school in which
religion, belittled by the pettiness and the casuistry of the Jesuits,
once more presented itself in its grandeur and its severity.</p>
<p>The excellence of Santeul&rsquo;s hymns at once created a demand
for their introduction in other churches and dioceses, and for his
services as a hymn-writer. Several of the best were introduced by
Archbishop Harlay into the later editions of his revised Paris
Breviary, which had appeared in 1680. So the bishops of many
other French dioceses&mdash;Rouen, Sens, Narbonne, Massillon of
Clermont, and others&mdash;adopted his hymns into their breviaries
after his death. And as he gallantly said, he had the pleasure
while still living of hearing them &ldquo;sung by the angels at Port
Royal.&rdquo; Other orders begged him to commemorate their founders
and their especial saints; dioceses and churches in other parts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
France invoked his good offices. Hence it is that of his two
hundred and twenty-eight hymns not one in five is occupied with
the great festivals of the Church year, but are specific or general
hymns to the honor of the saints, martyrs, and doctors of the
Church of France especially.</p>
<p>The rush of popularity&mdash;not unaccompanied by solid rewards,
for the good fathers of the Cluny Order gave him a pension&mdash;seems
to have turned Santeul&rsquo;s not very well-balanced head. Le
Tourneux&rsquo;s admonitions were forgotten. He ran from church
to church to hear his hymns sung, and scandalized congregations
by his demonstrations of delight or disgust as the music was appropriate
or otherwise; he declaimed them in all sorts of places,
suitable and unsuitable, to extort the admiration he loved so
dearly. He did not forget to tell that even the severe De Rance
had written from La Trappe to thank him for his hymn on St.
Bernard, but that for his own part he valued the general hymn on
the Doctors of the Church above any other. Naturally he had
little good to say of the hymns his were to displace. If anything
could make a pagan of him, it would be the bad grammar of
those old monkish poets, who sacrificed sense and grammar alike
to their stupid rhymes. And so he would run on by the hour to
anybody who would listen, with an egotism whose very childishness
and frankness made it inoffensive.</p>
<p>Of course he claimed the distinction of being the best Latin
poet in France. French poetry he despised, as being written in a
language incapable of the terse elegance of Latin. But in Latin
verse he would hear of no rival. Du P&eacute;rier, who had quite as
much vanity, with only a fraction of his genius, challenged his pretensions.
The two poets wrote verses on the same theme, and
then set out to find an arbiter. The first friend to whom they
appealed was M&eacute;nage, who evaded the responsibility by declaring
them equally excellent. The next they met was Racine. He
first got possession of the stakes and deposited them in the poor&rsquo;s
box at the door of a church near by, and then gave the poets a
round scolding for their absurd rivalry!</p>
<p>The hymns of Santeul are best known to English readers
through <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, which contain some very fine
versions, original and selected. Not included there is that which
Sainte Beuve pronounces his finest hymn, and for whose retention
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
in the Breviary he pleads against the crusaders, who in the name
of antiquity insist on replacing Santeul and Coffin by Strada and
Galucci. Out of respect for the greatest of modern critics, we reprint
it, with a translation from the pen of Dr. A. R. Thompson.
It commemorates the Presentation of our Lord in the Temple.</p>

<p>As a poet Santeul fell from grace in 1689, when he fell back on
his pagan divinities in a poem addressed to the keeper of the royal
gardens. Bossuet made a great ado over it, but F&eacute;nelon and others
judged him more gently. Next year he goes to see La Trappe,
and writes a fine poem on Holy Solitude (<i>Sancta Solitudo</i>), which
extorted fresh praise from De Rance, and afterward from Sainte-Beuve.
But four years later he got into the worst scrape of his
life by a flattering epitaph on the great Arnauld, who died in
1694. Santeul always had been more or less associated with the
Jansenist party, a fact which was not forgotten when his hymns
were expelled from the churches of France in our own century.
There is preserved an account of a visit he paid to Port Royal, in
which he chattered to the nuns with equal freedom of his own
hymns and of their virtues. But he was not of the stuff of which
martyrs are made. The Jesuits had the king&rsquo;s ear, and he was a
pensioner of the king&rsquo;s bounty. They assailed him for his eulogy
of the arch-Jansenist, and threatened him with the disfavor of
Louis XIV.; and he hastened to make amends in a poetical
epistle, of which he made two copies. By the adroit change of
the tense of a single word he made the copy for the Jesuits retract
his praises of his great friend, while that for the general public did
nothing of the sort. As a consequence he came off with no credit
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
on either side. Both Jesuits and Jansenists resented his duplicity,
and a fine shower of squibs and pamphlets fell on him from both
the hostile forces, until he was forced to cry for quarter, and
Bourdaloue made his peace.</p>
<p>He died in 1697 in Burgundy, whither he had accompanied
the younger Cond&eacute; to the meeting of the Estates. St. Simon has
told a very unpleasant story of the cause of his death. He ascribes
it to Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s having made him drink a bowl of wine into which
he had emptied his snuff-box, &ldquo;just to see what would come of
it.&rdquo; But the prince of scandalmongers has been disproven on
this point. Santeul&rsquo;s death was due to no such cause, but to an
inflammation of the bowels and to the malpractice of his doctors,
who gave him emetics under the false impression that he was
suffering from a surfeit. He made a good end, dying with resignation,
and begging pardon for the scandal his life had caused.</p>
<p>His hymns were not without their critics in his own age. Jean
Baptiste Thiers, a parish priest of great learning and bad temper,
assailed the Breviary of Cluny (in his <i>Commentarii de novo Breviario
Cluniacensi</i>, Brussels, 1702), and did not spare Santeul&rsquo;s hymns,
which he declared to be much inferior to those which had come
down from the earlier days of the Church. He declared that
Santeul had a greater abundance of words than of sense, that he
had almost no powers of thought, and that some of his images,
such as that in which he wreathes a garland of stones for the
martyr Stephen, were simply ridiculous. He was answered not
by Rabusson, but by his associate, Claude de Vert, after what
fashion I do not know.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was in 1736 that the Breviary of the Diocese of Paris was
published in its third and final revision by a commission of three
ecclesiastics: Fran&ccedil;ois-Antoine Vigier, Fran&ccedil;ois-Philippe Mesengui,
and Charles Coffin. It is a significant fact that the second
belonged to that Jansenist party in the Church which the relentless
efforts of the Pope, the hierarchy, and the kings of France had not
been able to exterminate. Archbishop de Vintimille was as eager
to accomplish that as his predecessors had been, and he was ably
seconded by that pious and orthodox prince, Louis XV. But
this revision, like that of 1670-80, was a concession to the historical
criticism which the Jansenists had brought to bear upon the
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
Church books both as to the legends of the saints and the extravagances
of the growing devotion to the Mother of our Lord. Mesengui
had been dismissed from the post Coffin had given him in
the University of Paris for his opposition to the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>,
which condemned Quesnel&rsquo;s Jansenist <i>Reflections on the New Testament</i>.
Coffin&rsquo;s sympathies lay in the same direction.</p>
<p>Charles Coffin is the man of the three who chiefly concerns us
here. Born at Buzancy, hard by Rheims, in 1676, he very early
distinguished himself as a Latin poet and an educator. He graduated
at Paris in 1701, and became a teacher in the College of
Dormans-Beauvais, and then its principal in 1713. Five years
later he was chosen to succeed Rollin as Rector of the University
of Paris. He at once showed his force of character by revolutionizing
the relation of the university to the public through abolishing
the fees exacted of the students. To replace them he extended
and developed the system of posts and messages, which the university
had established in the thirteenth century and which coexisted
with the post-office system of the government, of which it was the
forerunner. He devoted its revenues to the support of the colleges.
He must have been a character of great administrative capacity, as
his plans had entire success, and probably did much to foster the
development of the post-office system of France. After remaining
rector for three years, he went back to his place at the head of the
Dormans-Beauvais College, and remained there till his death.</p>
<p>It was in 1727 that Charles Coffin published his first volume of
Latin poetry. The most notable piece in the collection was a fine
ode in praise of Champagne. So much were the people of the
Champagne country pleased with it, that they sent him a hamper
of every vintage as long as he lived, which was twenty-two years.
He also had a hand in carrying Cardinal de Polignac&rsquo;s great poem,
<i>Anti-Lucretius</i>, to the state of completeness in which it was given
to the public in 1745, three years after its author&rsquo;s death. He
undertook the work of revising the old hymns and preparing new
with great reluctance, yielding only to the entreaties of the archbishop.</p>
<p>It was in 1736 that the Breviary Commission finished their
labors and the archbishop gave to the diocese the new Breviary,
which was adopted by more than fifty French dioceses. Its general
character does not concern us here. It is with its hymns
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
alone we have to do. About seventy of the primitive and mediaeval
hymns still held their place in the Breviary of 1680, nearly
half of them the work of Ambrose and his school. The revisers
spared very few of these. Only twenty-one hymns of the earlier
period were left, while eighty-five of Jean Santeul&rsquo;s, nearly a hundred
by Coffin himself&mdash;including some recasts of old hymns&mdash;and
ninety-seven by other authors, chiefly Frenchmen of later
date, were inserted. There were eleven by Guillaume de la
Bruneti&egrave;re, a friend of Bossuet&rsquo;s; six each by Claude Santeul,
Nicolas le Tourneux, and Sebastian Besnault, a priest of Sens;
five by Isaac Habert, Bishop of Vabres; four by the Jesuit Jean
Commire; two each by the Jesuit Francis Guyet and Simon
Gourdan of the Abbey of St. Victor; one each by Marc Antoine
Muretus, Denis Petau, and Guillaume du Plessis de Geste; one
(or three) by M. Combault, a young friend of Charles Coffin&rsquo;s.
This was modernism with a vengeance! New hymns were nearly
thirteen to one in proportion to those from the great storehouse
of the ages before the Reformation. It is not wonderful that so
extreme a policy called forth a reaction as soon as the Romanticist
movement, with its juster appreciation of the Middle Ages, had
reached France. But by the end of the eighteenth century the
old Latin hymns were banished practically from France.</p>
<p>As compared with Jean Santeul, Charles Coffin displays much less
poetic audacity than his predecessor. You do not feel that poetry
filled the same place in his intellectual existence, or that he was
under the same necessity to write it. He has less genius, but a
great talent for verse. And&mdash;what the critics of that age valued
the most&mdash;he was more correct in his handling of the vocabulary
and the metre of Latin versification. Santeul found classic Latin,
much as he admired it, something of a fetter to the free movement
of his genius. It was a dead language he was trying to put intense
life into&mdash;an old bottle for his new wine&mdash;and at times the
bottle burst. Just because Charles Coffin&rsquo;s wine is not so new,
his inspiration not so fresh, the bottle holds out better. And
then he had the greater advantage of a closer familiarity with the
ideas he wished to embody in his hymns, and with their sources
in the Scriptures, and a more practical capacity for the application
of his powers to the object in hand. His hymns are always
in place; they are hymns of the Breviary, not brilliant poems on
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
Breviary subjects by a poet writing for glory. I do not say that
Charles Coffin was the better man; God only knows; and I must
confess to a liking for &ldquo;the gay canon of St. Victor&rdquo; which the
rector of the university does not inspire in me. There is a Burns-like
humanity in him and his harmless vanities which wins our
love still, as it did that of his contemporaries. But Charles
Coffin had a certain suitableness to his work which Jean Santeul
lacked. He was an eminently dignified, respectable, and useful
character, who impressed himself upon a whole generation of
young Frenchmen, many of whom rose to eminence at the bar, in
the public service, and even in the army. They all looked back
to him with great respect. I wonder if they loved him as Mark
Hopkins and George Allen are loved by those who studied under
them. And in Charles Coffin&rsquo;s hymns you meet the same admirable
traits as in his public work. He is a man of enlightenment,
dignity, devoutness, and eminent usefulness, without a touch of
Rabelaisian <i>abandon</i> to remind you of B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s saying: &ldquo;All
we <i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i> are children of the great Fran&ccedil;ois.&rdquo; Of that he reminds
you only in his sparkling, effervescent ode to Champagne,
in reply to B&eacute;nigne Grenan&rsquo;s overpraise of Burgundy. It was to
be expected that when the advocates of liturgical uniformity made
their attack upon the Paris Breviary, beginning with Gueranger&rsquo;s
<i>Institutions Liturgiques</i> (1840-42), it was Santeul whom they
especially attacked, although not he but Coffin was responsible
for its hymnology.</p>
<p>Charles Coffin&rsquo;s hymns have a high level of excellence, which
makes it difficult to anthologize among them. Certainly not
the worst are the four Advent hymns (<i>Instantis adventum Dei</i>;
<i>Jordanis oras praevia</i>; <i>Statuta decreto Dei</i>; and <i>In noctis umbra
desides</i>); that for Christmas (<i>Jam desinant suspiria</i>) and the Vesper
hymn (<i>O luce qui mortalibus</i>); the Passion hymn (<i>Opprobriis Jesu
satur</i>); the fine series of seven hymns for the nocturn services
throughout the week, based on the seven days of Creation; and
the hymn for Epiphany (<i>Quae stella sole pulchrior</i>). These and
most of his acknowledged hymns are known to us in the translations
of Williams, Chandler, and Mant, and several of these are in
<i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>.</p>
<p>As an editor he altered and even tinkered, as well as adapted
and wrote hymns. Even Jean Santeul did not escape his hand.
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
One of the hymns ascribed to him in the Paris Breviary is a cento
from no less than twelve of his own hymns. From the wrath he
showed when such changes were made in his lifetime, we may
infer that he would have liked this as little as did John Wesley.
And the older hymns were handled in the same way. A good
example of Charles Coffin&rsquo;s method of recasting old hymns is furnished
by his version of the <i>Ad coenam Agni providi</i>, which already
has been given in its original shape and in that of the Roman
Breviary. With these the reader may compare Coffin&rsquo;s revision,
which will be seen to vary very widely from the old text of the
ninth century:</p>

<p>It will be observed that while the ideas, and even to some extent
the phraseology of the old hymn are retained in the first six verses,
their order is so changed as to suggest that we have an original
hymn before us, if we do not look closely. But the last verse is
altogether different. The old poet prayed that the paschal joy
might be made unending through the deliverance of the regenerate
from the death eternal. The modern prays that we may share
mystically in the death and resurrection of Christ, and learn
thereby to set our affections on things above. Similar are his recasts
of the <i>Salvete flores Martyrum</i> of Prudentius, and the Ambrosian
<i>Jam lucis orto sidere</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffield has left only one completed version of a hymn
from the Paris Breviary, and that one whose authorship I am unable
to determine. It attracted him as one of the surprisingly few
hymns in which the comparison of the Christian life to a warfare,
so frequently used by our Lord and the Apostle Paul, is employed
as a leading idea. His interest in such hymns no doubt was first
awakened by his father&rsquo;s admirable and popular one:</p>
<dl>
<dd><p class="t0">&ldquo;Stand up, stand up for Jesus,&rdquo;</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>suggested by the dying words of Dudley Tyng.

<p>Of the other writers of the Breviary only a few need detain us.
Most of them are poets of the conventional sort, whose verse evidences
the care taken with their education rather than their possession
of any native genius, although Jean Commire (1625-1702)
was of wide reputation in his day. Even of good Claude
Santeul the best that can be said is that several of his hymns have
passed for the composition of his brother, and that the two Trinity
hymns (<i>Ter sancte, ter potens Deus</i> and <i>O luce quae tua lates</i>) and
the three on Lazarus (<i>Redditum luce, Domino vocante, Panditur saxo
tumulus remoto</i>, and <i>Intrante Christo Bethanicam domum</i>) deserve the
honor. They make us regret the loss of these two manuscript
volumes. An unfinished translation of one of these, left by Mr.
Duffield, has been completed for us by Dr. A. R. Thompson.
The asterisk marks the transition from the one translator to the other&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>Next we have Nicolas le Tourneux (1640-1686), the severe
Jansenist, whose preaching drew such crowds in Paris that the King
asked the reason. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Boileau, &ldquo;your Majesty
knows how people run after novelty; this is a preacher who
preaches the Gospel. When he mounts the pulpit, he frightens
you by his ugliness, so that you wish he would leave it; and
when he begins to speak, you are afraid that he may.&rdquo; It was his
<i>Ann&eacute;e Chr&eacute;tienne</i> which suggested the <i>Christian Year</i> to John
Keble. We have seen how he coached Jean Santeul both as to
the matter of his hymns and the right spirit for a Christian poet.
But the great preacher&rsquo;s own hymns are <i>sermoni propriores</i>, &ldquo;properer
for a sermon,&rdquo; to borrow Lamb&rsquo;s mistranslation. Verse was
a fetter to him, not a wing. His best are the Ascension hymn,
<i>Adeste, Coelitum chori</i>, and that on the Baptist, <i>Jussu tyranni pro
fide</i>. The former we give in the excellent translation of Rev. A.
R. Thompson, D.D.:</p>

</div>
<p>A man of very different powers is the Abb&eacute; Sebastian Besnault,
of whom nothing is told us except that he was chaplain of the
parish of St. Maurice in Sens, and died in 1726. The six hymns
ascribed to him in the Paris Breviary are among the finest in that
collection. Three are hymns on the Circumcision (<i>Debilis cessent
elementa legis</i>; <i>Felix dies, quam proprio</i>; and <i>Noxium Christus simul
introivit</i>); one is an Ascension hymn (<i>Promissa, tellus, concipe
gaudium</i>), and two are Dedication hymns (<i>Ecce sedes hic Tonantis</i>
and <i>Urbs beata, vera pacis</i>), the latter being a recast of the
<i>Urbs beata Hierusalem</i>. Quite justly does A. Gazier (in his thesis
<i>De Santolii Victorini Sacris Hymnis</i>, Paris, 1875) say that if Besnault
equalled Jean Santeul in the volume of his hymns, he would
not rank below him as a sacred poet, since he quite equals him
in his Latinity and is his superior as a spiritual writer. We give
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
Dr. A. R. Thompson&rsquo;s version of his recast of the <i>Urbs beata
Hierusalem</i>:</p>

</div>
<p>Along with Coffin should be named one of his friends, a young
advocate named Combault, who possessed something of the spirit
and energy of Jean Santeul. How far he contributed to the
Breviary of 1736 I am unable to say, but a well-founded tradition
designates him as the author of a splendid rhetorical hymn in
commemoration of the Apostles Peter and Paul (<i>Tandem laborum
<span class="pb" id="Page_346">346</span>
gloriosi Principes</i>), which has been much admired. Combault
died in 1785.</p>
<p>The whole impression which this school of hymn-writers makes
upon us is like that of the Greco-French architecture of our own
age. Both reflect the critical and useful, but somewhat exclusive
spirit of the Renaissance. Both are capable of fine effects, great
structural beauty, and a certain grandeur not of the highest order.
But a Greco-French church will not bear comparison with Notre
Dame; and the hymns of Santeul and Coffin will hardly better
endure a comparison with the Christian singers who wrote when
Notre Dame was new.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">347</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE UNKNOWN AND THE LESS KNOWN HYMN-WRITERS.
<br />[<span class="sc">Fourth to Tenth Century.</span>]</span></h2>
<p>The known is but a fragment broken from the unknown. This
is eminently true as regards the authorship of the Latin hymns.
When we have dealt as tenderly as the historical conscience will
permit with the traditions which assign hymns to this and that
author, we still find ourselves unable to affix any name to the
great majority. And while it is true that the most part of the very
great hymns are not left in this plight of anonymity, it is true that
no small number of the best are on the record like Melchizedek&mdash;&ldquo;without
father or mother,&rdquo; and many of them also &ldquo;without
beginning of years,&rdquo; for we can determine only approximately the
century of their origin. Nor is this at all surprising. Fame was
neither the object nor the expectation of the writers of the Latin
hymns of the early and Middle Ages. Their utmost expectation,
probably, was to be valued a little by their brethren in their own
and their sister monasteries as the author of a fine sequence or an
appropriate hymn for a yearly festival. It was enough for that
purpose that the report of their authorship passed from mouth to
mouth in the choir, without any record made of it. The love of
glory as a literary motive, came in, as Mr. Symonds reminds us,
with the Renaissance, which borrowed it from the old pagans.
Many a devout singer of the centuries before that practised the
wisdom of &agrave; Kempis&rsquo;s saying, <i>Ama nesciri</i>, &ldquo;Love to be unknown.&rdquo;
They wrote not for gain in renown, but for use in the
edification of their brethren and of the Church. And to live for
use rather than gain is to live Christianly, for, as Swedenborg says,
&ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is a kingdom of uses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This and the next chapter we shall give partly to some of these
orphaned hymns, touching only on the greatest. And as we come
down the centuries we shall speak also of the less notable hymn-writers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
some of them not less notable as men or as Churchmen,
but such as have made less of a mark in hymnology.</p>
<p>At the outset we are met by two of the greatest of the sacred
songs of the Church, which are none the less hymns although
classed technically as canticles. Who wrote the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>
and the <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>? As everybody knows, the opening
words of the former are the song of the angels who brought the
good news to the shepherds&mdash;words which authenticate their
heavenly origin by their simplicity, beauty, and force&mdash;&ldquo;a master-song,&rdquo;
as Luther says, &ldquo;which neither grew nor was made on
earth, but came down from heaven.&rdquo; But the much longer supplement,
which evidently reflects the situation of the Church in
the days of the Arian controversy, must either have originated in
the fourth century and in the East, or must have been altered to
adapt it to that time. The original still exists in Greek, but in
three forms, which differ somewhat; and the Latin version is defective
in that it follows a later form than that which is given in
the so-called <i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>; and, of course, the English
follows the Latin, except in the part taken from the Gospel, where
&ldquo;good will to men&rdquo; takes the place of &ldquo;to men of good will&rdquo;
(<i>hominibus bonae voluntatis</i>), the latter being the reading adopted
by the English translators of 1611, but rejected by the revisers of
1883.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Who made the Latin version? An untrustworthy tradition
ascribes it to Telesphorus, who was Bishop of Rome in 128-38.
It is possible that he prescribed the chanting of the Scripture words
in the Church service; but the whole hymn is of later date in
Latin. There is much more likelihood that it was, according to
a tradition recorded by Alcuin in the ninth century, the work of
Hilary of Poitiers, the first Latin hymn-writer.</p>
<p>The <i>Te Deum laudamus</i> has some claims to be regarded as the
greatest of Christian hymns. Like the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> it belongs
to that first period of Christian hymn-writing, when the
Hebrew psalms still furnished the models for Christian poets, and
the same free movement of rhythmical prose was all that was required
or even tolerated. There is no mention of it in Church
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
literature before the sixth century, when the monastic rules of
both Caesarius of Arles (<i>c.</i> 527) and of Benedict of Nursia (<i>c.</i> 530)
prescribe its use, and the Council of Toledo mentions it. As it
uses the words of the Vulgate in verses 22-25 and 27 to the end, it
cannot, as it now stands, be much more than a century older than
this, as the date of the Vulgate is 382-404. Yet a tradition
recorded by Abbot Abbo of Fleury in the ninth century, ascribes
this hymn also to Hilary of Poitiers, who died fifteen years before
Jerome put his hand to the work of revising the Latin Bible.
Daniel thinks to reconcile the discrepancy by ascribing it to Hilary
of Arles, who was born the year before Jerome had finished his
work, and by regarding it as a translation from the Greek, as
verses 22-26 certainly are. They are found in the Appendix to the
Alexandrian manuscript of the Greek New Testament, where they
follow the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> with the interruption only of an
Amen. But is it not possible to regard the last eight verses as a
separate hymn, made up, with the exception of the strong verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn"> 26. </span>Dignare, Domine, die isto sine peccato nos custodire&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>of verses from the Scriptures? These last verses have no internal
connection with the first twenty-two, and they differ decidedly in
style, form, and source. Those contain no Scripture quotations,
except the <i>Ter-Sanctus</i> in verses 5 and 6, which is not taken from
the Vulgate version,<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
but apparently from the Itala. If, therefore,
we consider those twenty-two verses as a hymn by themselves, this
may have been the work of Hilary of Poitiers, and there is no
necessity for assuming that it was not an original Latin hymn.
This becomes more probable if we drop out verse 13, which interrupts
the flow of the Christological thought, and evidently was
interpolated to make the hymn complete from a Trinitarian point
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
of view. When the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> and the <i>Te Deum</i> were
composed, it was the relation of the Son to the Father which occupied
the mind of the Church. Both hymns are the expression of
&ldquo;the present truth&rdquo; on that subject; the mention of the Holy
Spirit in both is probably by interpolation at a later date.</p>
<p>As the form, and in some places the meaning of the <i>Te Deum</i> is
misrepresented in the current version, it may be worth while to
reproduce the original in a more literal version:</p>

<p>There are no other unfathered hymns known to be of this century,
and few less notable hymn-writers. To Jerome is ascribed
a hymn, <i>Te Bethlehem celebrat</i>, which is not in any of the collections.
His great contemporary, Augustine of Hippo, has had
more than one fine hymn assigned to him, probably because his
works have furnished the suggestion for so many. Notably Peter
Damiani and Hildebert of Tours drew upon him. But the great
theologian was not a poet, as we can see from his one essay in
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
that form, viz., his &ldquo;psalm&rdquo; against the Donatists, in which he
gives a popular and metrical exposition of the parable of the net
(Matt. 13:47-50). It is quite enough to prove that he did not
write the <i>Ad perennis vitae fontem</i> (Damiani), or the <i>Quid, tyranne,
quid minaris</i> (Damiani), or the <i>O gens beata coelitum</i>, or even the
<i>Domine Jesu, noverim me</i>, all of which have been given to him at
times.</p>
<p>To the fifth century&mdash;the century of Prudentius and Ennodius&mdash;we
may ascribe the earlier in the large group of hymns classed as
Ambrosian, which are the work of a series of writers who may be
described as constituting a school. It is one of the hardest problems
in Latin hymnology to distinguish between Ambrose&rsquo;s own
work and that of his imitators, and to arrange the hymns composed
by the latter between the fifth and the eighth century in any
chronological order. What can be said positively has been shown
in Chapter V. The chief authorities on the subject are the early
collectors, Clichtove, Cassander, and Thomasius. Of considerable
importance is the <span class="small">MS.</span> given by Francis Junius in the seventeenth
century to the University of Oxford, and published in 1830
by Jacob Grimm. It contains a collection of twenty-six hymns
by Ambrose and the Ambrosians, with a translation into old High
German, probably made at St. Gall in the ninth century. But
these do not exhaust the list. Others have been pointed out by
Mone and other collectors, as proving their kinship to the school
by their metrical form or their contents and style. Schletterer
enumerates ninety hymns of the school, and of these he assigns
fifteen to Ambrose himself.</p>
<p>Closely related to the group, and yet not assigned to it, are
several hymns to which a very early date is assigned by Mone at
least. To this fifth century he gives the <i>Unam duorum gloriam</i>,
which he also claims as of German origin, and describes as one of
the oldest hymns of the German Church. It is in commemoration
of two martyrs, to whose honor a church near M&uuml;nster was dedicated,
and is strictly classic in metre. Here also he assigns the
<i>Christi caterva clamitat</i>, an Advent hymn of classic metre and primitive
tone. He probably would agree with Wackernagel in selecting
the same century for the hymn on Stephen, the protomartyr,
<i>Primatis aulae coelicae</i>, in which he finds reminders of the style of
Prudentius. Lastly, he assigns this date to the Paschal hymn, <i>Te
<span class="pb" id="Page_352">352</span>
lucis auctor personat</i>, which became obsolete when its special reference
to Easter as the time of the baptism of adult catechumens lost
its significance. It was used in France and probably other countries.</p>
<p>To the same fifth century belongs Paulinus, Bishop of Nola
(353-431), who has many better claims to remembrance than his
hymns. He was one of those men of whom their contemporaries
cannot speak without enthusiasm, and as Augustine, Jerome, and
Ambrose are among his eulogists we may assume that the praise
was not undeserved. He came of a noble Gallic stock; he inherited
wealth and acquired from the teaching of the poet Ausonius
all the culture of his time; he filled high office in Italy and
Spain; he spent the last twenty-two years of his life in administering
with a faithful laboriousness the affairs of a Campanian bishopric.
He did not receive baptism until his thirty-fifth year, so that
he may have been brought up a pagan, although the inference is
not necessary. In 378 he was made Roman consul to fill an unexpired
term (<i>consul suffectus</i>), and was sent into Campania at the
end of the year. There he was so deeply impressed by a festival
in honor of the martyr Vincent of Nola, that his affections were
drawn strongly to the city. But soon after he married a Spanish
wife and went to live first at Bordeaux and then at Barcelona.
At the former in 389 he was received into the membership of the
Church; at the latter he and his wife, after the death of their
infant son, resolved to renounce the &ldquo;secular&rdquo; life and to give
themselves to asceticism and charity. He was ordained to the
priesthood in response to a general demand of the people during
the Christmas festivities. He removed to Nola, where he and his
wife lived in the service of the poor, in an age when the incursions
of Goths and Vandals were producing frightful wretchedness.
He seems to have held right views of the responsibility of property,
and instead of divesting himself of it at once, he kept it to use for
his brethren. Nor did he separate from his wife after the fashion
of Ennodius and others of the age. They labored together to the
end. About 409 he was elected Bishop of Nola, and occupied
that see until his death. Among his gifts to his people was a new
aqueduct to supply their town with pure water, an evidence of his
breadth of mind and genuine humanity. When he died he was
added to the list of the recognized saints, and few with better right.</p>
<p>His literary achievement was not great, although everything he
<span class="pb" id="Page_353">353</span>
has written has its interest. His epistles and poems are reflections
of both his excellence and his faults. They show at once the good
heart of the man and his proneness to superstition. But his contemporaries
thought his poems wonderful, and even some of the
moderns have re-echoed this estimate. Erasmus calls him &ldquo;the
Christian Cicero,&rdquo; a title more frequently assigned to Lactantius.
Caspar Barth, in his <i>Adversaria</i> (1624), declines to rank any other
Christian poet above him. His poems exhibit the decadence of
Latin verse, in that quantity is often neglected and accent used to
replace it. Only a few of them are hymns in any sense, and these
are narrative or reflective rather than lyric. Bjorn gives two of
them in his collection.</p>
<p>This fifth century also brings us the first woman among the
Christian singers. Elpis, identified by a somewhat doubtful tradition
with Helpes, the first wife of the pagan philosopher Boethius,
has left a florid hymn in honor of the Apostles Peter and Paul,
which holds its place in modified form in the Roman Breviary,
and is divided into two hymns. She employs accentuated verse,
while the verses in Boethius&rsquo;s classic work, <i>De Consolatione Philosophiae</i>,
conform to the quantitative prosody of classic poetry.
Another hymn on the same Apostles, <i>Felix per omnes festum mundi
cardines</i>, is ascribed to her and also to Paulinus of Nola. The
Breviary hymn, <i>Miris modis repente liber</i>, is a recast of part of it.</p>
<p>There are several poems and chronicles which are ascribed to
Prosper Tyro, whom some identify with Prosper of Aquitaine
(403-65), the Gallic champion of strict Augustinian orthodoxy
against the semi-Pelagian party in that province&mdash;John Cassian,
Vincent of Lerins, etc. This is the more likely, as Prosper loved
to &ldquo;drop into poetry&rdquo; even in his controversial treatises. George
Cassander includes a hymn from Prosper Tyro&rsquo;s works in his
collection.</p>
<p>Many of the finest of Ambrosian hymns, which have taken rank
among the favorites of Western Christendom, as sharing the noble
spirit and the torrent-like power of utterance of the great Bishop of
Milan, are credited by the hymnologists to the sixth century&mdash;the
age of Benedict of Nursia, Caesarius of Arles, Belisarius, and
Gregory the Great. We give Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s translation of two of
the finest, regretting that he did not live to translate others which
he had marked with that view in his Index:</p>

</div>
<p>To the same sixth century belong some notable hymns which
have not even a school to which to assign their paternity. The
most famous of these is the</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ad coenam Agni providi</i>,</dd>
</dl>
<p>which has been twice rewritten in conformity with the laws of
classic prosody, reappearing in the Roman Breviary as the <i>Ad
regias Agni dapes</i>, and in the Paris Breviary as the <i>Forti tegente
brachio</i>. In English there have been at least twelve versions since
1710. The great merit of the hymn is the vigorous and terse way
in which the mystical correspondence of the Christian sacrament
to the Jewish passover, and of our deliverance from the yoke of
Satan to the Jewish deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, are
worked out. As Daniel suggests, its first stanza refers to the old
usage that the catechumens, who had received baptism just before
Easter, partook of the other sacrament on the first Sunday after
Easter (<i>Dominicus in albis</i>), wearing the white robes of their baptism
(<i>stolis albis candidi</i>). Another notable but fatherless hymn of this
age is the <i>Sanctorum meritis inclyta gaudiis</i>&mdash;a beautiful commemoration
of the martyrs whose sufferings were still so vividly remembered
by the Church. Quite worthy of mention also is the Lenten
hymn, <i>Jam Christe, sol justitiae</i>, which expresses the early Christian
attitude toward God&rsquo;s works, connecting the looked-for Easter
with the renewal of the world by the spring&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Dies venit, dies tua</p>
<p class="t0">In qua reflorent omnia.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The hymn for All Saints Day, <i>Psallat plebis sexus omnis voce
corde carmina</i>, is notable not only for its own vigor, but as being
one of the oldest in which the alliterative principle of the early
Celtic and Teutonic verse is employed in Latin. It therefore
comes from the North of Europe, with the chances in favor of
Ireland.</p>
<p>Of known but less important hymn-writers of the sixth century
we have only two, Columba and Flavius. The former is the great
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">356</span>
Irish missionary known to his countrymen as Columcille (the
Dove, or the Dove of the Church), who lived <span class="small">A.D.</span> 521 to 597.
He was one of the O&rsquo;Donnells of Donegal, whose chiefs, something
more than seventy years before his birth, had offered especial
opposition to Patrick&rsquo;s preaching. He studied in the great school
founded at Clonard, on the upper waters of the Boyne, by Finnian,
the first of those teachers who made the Ireland of this and the
following centuries &ldquo;the land of schools,&rdquo; to which students
flocked from Great Britain and even the Continent. Finnian sent
him to Clonfad to obtain ordination as a bishop; but the bishop,
who was ploughing in the field when he came, made a mistake
and gave him ordination as a priest. And he never rose higher
than this in hierarchical dignity. Not that it mattered much in
the very elastic system of Church government Patrick had established
in Ireland. The tribal or sept system was copied in the
Church arrangement. At the head of each church sept stood a
<i>coarb</i>, who might be a woman, and frequently was a priest or
deacon. Under this jurisdiction the bishops took the same relative
place that the bards held to the chiefs in the civil tribes. Sometimes
there would be a dozen of these right reverend fathers in
God in one small Irish town, all under the direction of a female
<i>coarb</i>, miscalled an abbess by later authors, as the Church sept has
been miscalled a monastery.</p>
<p>As a penance for having been the cause of a faction fight or
civil war&mdash;one hardly knows which to call it&mdash;over the ownership
of a psalter, Columba banished himself from Ireland and took up
his abode at Iona (or Hy), from which centre he preached the
Gospel to the Scots (<i>i.e.</i>, Irish) and Picts (<i>i.e.</i>, Welsh) of the
Highlands and the Western Islands. The former had conquered
this region in the fifth century and were yet to give their name to
the whole country, although up to <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1198 there is no instance
of Scotus meaning Scotchman rather than Irishman. But while
Christianity had penetrated even the wilds of Donegal in Ireland,
these Irish of Scotland and their Cymric subjects still were pagans.
So as Patrick was Scotland&rsquo;s gift to Ireland, Columcille was Ireland&rsquo;s
to Scotland. He was the type of those persuasive and successful
missionaries which the Church of Patrick sent through
Great Britain and to the Continent. He used the power of song
very freely in his missionary labors, confounding the Druids and
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
attracting the people by the grave, sweet melody of the Church&rsquo;s
chants. Like Whitefield and Summerfield, he had a wonderful,
because pure voice and could sing so as to be heard a mile away.
He, too, was a poet of no mean merit. The sorrows of his voluntary
exile from the land of his birth&mdash;the land which exercises
such a weird fascination over her children that all other lands are
to her what prose is to poetry or water to wine&mdash;seem to have
wakened in him the gift of song. Less beautiful than these patriotic
elegies is the abecedarian hymn on the spiritual history of our
world, <i>Altus prositor, vetustus dierum, et ingenitus</i>, which is given
in the Appendix to the <i>Lyra Sacra Hibernica</i> (Belfast, 1879) and
in the second part of Dr. J. H. Todd&rsquo;s <i>Liber Hymnorum</i>. It is
written in a very rude Latinity, and is intended for instruction and
edification rather than lyric expression. But it is an interesting
monument of the faith of the great missionary, as it brings us
nearer him than does the wonderful biography by Abbot Adamnan,
his seventh successor at Iona. It was first printed in 1657
by the Irish scholar Colgan, and with it two other and shorter
hymns (<i>In Te, Christe, credentium</i> and <i>Noli, Pater, indulgere</i>),
which also may be Columcille&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Flavius was Bishop of Chalons in the year 580, and has left one
hymn, <i>Tellus et aeth&rsquo;ra jubilent</i>, which Daniel calls an excellent
poem (<i>carmen eximium</i>). Its theme is our Lord&rsquo;s washing the
feet of the Apostles, and for this reason it was commonly sung
after meals in some monasteries.</p>
<p>Of the seventh century, the century of Heraclius and Mahomet,
there is not one great hymn-writer known as such, but there are
some great hymns. The greatest is the <i>Urbs beata Hirusalem,
dicta pacis visio</i>, of which the <i>Angulare fundamentum</i> is a part, and
which is of the seventh or eighth century. Daniel, however, with
the support of Schlosser, regards this hymn as not certainly older
than the tenth century, and has Neale&rsquo;s support in asserting that
the last two verses are a later addition to give it suitableness for
singing at a dedication of a
church.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> The earliest mention of
its use in the tenth century is in the church of Poitiers at the
annual blessing of the font on Easter Sunday, which tends to confirm
<span class="pb" id="Page_358">358</span>
the supposition that two verses have been added. He thinks
it of Spanish origin, as the metrical form is one usual in the Mozarabic
Breviary. In later days it underwent three revisions. In
the old Paris Breviary of 1527 it becomes the <i>Urbs Jerusalem
beata</i>; in the new Breviary of 1736 it becomes the <i>Urbs beata,
vera pacis visio</i> under the hands of Abb&eacute; Besnault (<i>ob.</i> 1726). In
the Roman Breviary of 1631 it is the <i>Coelestis Urbs Jerusalem</i>, the
form, as usual, best known to modern readers and translators, but
not the best worth knowing. Along with the <i>Urbs beata</i> we may
place the <i>Gloriosa Jerusalem</i>, probably of Spanish origin, and of
the same century as well as similar in contents, but unequal in
beauty and poetic worth.</p>
<p>Next in worth is the abecedarian judgment hymn, <i>Apparabet repentina
dies magna Domini</i>, which Neale speaks of as containing
the germ of the <i>Dies Irae</i>. It is little more than a rehearsal in
a trochaic metre of our Lord&rsquo;s prediction of the Day of Judgment.
It follows the Scripture text much more closely than does Thomas
of Celano. Bede mentions it in the next century. Mrs. Charles
has translated it.</p>
<p>To this seventh century or the next Mone refers the <i>Salvator
mundi, Domine</i>, which is most probably an Anglo-Saxon hymn,
although of the Ambrosian school. It reappears in the Anglican
<i>Orarium</i> of 1560 and the <i>Preces Privatae</i> of 1564, and is said to
have been familiar to Sir Thomas Browne and Bishop Ken through
its use at Wykeham&rsquo;s school in Winchester. It, along with the
<i>Te lucis ante terminum</i>, also sung at Winchester, may have suggested
both Bishop Ken&rsquo;s &ldquo;Glory to thee, my God, this night,&rdquo;
and Browne&rsquo;s &ldquo;The night is come, like to the day,&rdquo; given in
his <i>Religio Medici</i>. To the seventh century we also may refer
the <i>Quicunque vultesse salvus</i>, a hymn better known as the
Athanasian Creed.</p>
<p>Besides these there are two groups of hymns whose temporal
limits do not lie within the seventh century on either side, but
which may be as well discussed here as anywhere. The first are
the early Spanish hymn-writers. We know by name three of the
seventh century. The first is Isidore, Archbishop of Seville (570-636),
the scholar of encyclopaedic range, who did so much to
adapt the learning of the Romans to the wants of the Gothic community
in Spain. To him are ascribed, somewhat doubtfully, three
<span class="pb" id="Page_359">359</span>
ballad-hymns in honor of as many martyrs and two abecedarian
poems on repentance. More certainly authentic are three or four
ascribed to his contemporary Eugenius, who was Archbishop of
Toledo from 646 to 657. He has left us thirty-two Latin poems
in classic metres, none of which, strictly speaking, are hymns, but
his <i>Rex Deus immense</i> has found its way into the collections. In
his day he worked hard to improve the singing and other services
of the Church. Lastly, there is the Spanish magistrate Cyxilla,
who built a church in honor of the martyr Thyrsus of Toledo,
and wrote a hymn for the dedication, though some say he got
Isidore to do it for him. Daniel (I., 190) gives it in full from
the Mozarabic<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> Breviary.
But far more important are the anonymous
hymns of that Breviary, which constituted the hymnary of
the old Spanish Church at the date of the conquest of the country
by the Saracens (711-14), and which through the temporary prostration
of the Church&rsquo;s energy was preserved from additions and
alterations. The collection therefore is interesting as containing
nothing of later date than the eighth century, and probably very
little that is later than the seventh. Besides a large number of
hymns traceable to other authors, from Hilary to Gregory&mdash;most
of them from Ambrose and his school&mdash;there are forty-eight hymns
peculiar to this ancient Breviary. Of these the best known are the
<i>Alleluia piis edite laudibus</i>, the <i>Cunctorum rex omnipotens</i>, the <i>Jesu
defensor omnium</i>, the <i>O Dei perenne Verbum</i> of Bishop Arturus
Serranus of Toledo, the <i>Sacer octavarum dies</i>, the <i>Sacrata Christi
tempora</i>, and the <i>Surgentes ad Te, Domine</i>. It is well known that
the hymns of Ambrose and his school enjoyed great repute in
Spain. These unnamed writers evidently have studied at his feet,
their mode of dealing with the great themes of Christian praise
having much in common with his. The country, however, which
gave Seneca, Lucan, and Quinctilian to Latin literature was under
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
no necessity merely to imitate an Italian model; and we find
these Spanish poets departing widely from Ambrose&rsquo;s school as
regards the form of their verse. The four-lined stanza, with four
iambic feet (u -) in each line&mdash;a line used by the tragedian
Seneca before it was adopted by the Christian poets&mdash;is the form
of verse employed almost exclusively by the Ambrosian school.
The Mozarabic writers also use it (<i>Convexa solis orbita</i>), but they
also employ as a substitute a trochaic verse of eleven syllables
(<i>Lucis auctor clemens, lumen immensum</i>) and more complex choriambic
forms (<i>Alleluia piis edite laudibus</i>, etc.). But their hymns,
as a whole, lack pith and force; not one of them has earned a
place by itself in the affections of Latin Christendom.</p>
<p>The second national group is that of the early Irish writers of
Latin hymns. There are not so many of these, and still fewer
names have been preserved. But they deserve notice as monuments
of that aggressive Church whose missionary labors rendered
such grand service in the Christianization of Western Europe. Of
Caelius Sedulius there is enough said in the chapter devoted to
him and his acrostic hymn. Of Columcille and the <i>Altus Deus
prositor</i> we have spoken above. The next name which meets us
is that of Ladkenus or Lathacan, an Irishman of the seventh century,
to whom is ascribed a hymn of the class called in Irish
<i>Luireach</i> (or <i>lorica</i>), meaning a shield. There are two hymns of
this class ascribed to Patrick and to Columcille. The former,
best known by James Clarence Mangan&rsquo;s version,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At Tara to-day, in this awful hour,</p>
<p class="t">I call on the holy Trinity!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>is probably not the work of the Apostle of Ireland; but as it, like
that of Columcille, is in Irish, it need not detain us here. The
latter begins,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Alone am I upon the mountain,</p>
<p class="t0">O King of heaven, prosper my way,</p>
<p class="t0">And then nothing need I fear,</p>
<p class="t0">More than if guarded by six thousand.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>That of Lathacan, while possessing the same general character,
as aiming at a Christian substitute for the Druidical charms of the
pagans, is on a lower level both religiously and poetically. No
less than eleven of its twenty-three quatrains are occupied with
<span class="pb" id="Page_361">361</span>
the enumeration of the parts of the human body, which are placed
under divine protection, and these may be not without interest to
the students of the history of physiological knowledge.</p>
<p>Many of the early Irish hymns are in the national language,
which was at that time the vehicle of a vigorous native poetry.
Of those in Latin the most beautiful is the Communion hymn,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sancti venite,</p>
<p class="t0">Christi corpus sumite,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>which both Daniel and Neale praise for its noble simplicity. An
old Irish legend, to which we need not pin our faith, represents
Patrick and his nephew Sechnall as hearing the angels sing it first,
during the offertory before the communion, and adds, &ldquo;So from
that time to the present that hymn is chanted in Erinn when the
body of Christ is received.&rdquo; Singing at the communion was not
unusual in the early Church, and Gregory of Tours has preserved
an antiphon used at that sacrament which closely resembles the
Irish hymn. But it is now disused.</p>
<p>The hymn is found in the Bangor Antiphonary, an old Irish
manuscript of the seventh century, first published by Muratori in
his <i>Anecdota</i> (1697-98). From Bangor it had been carried to
Bobbio, the famous monastery founded on Italian soil by the Irish
missionary Columbanus after he had been driven out of Burgundy
by the reigning powers. From Bobbio it made its way to the
Ambrosian Library at Milan, where Muratori found it. It is one
of the most interesting monuments of the early Irish Church, and
its hymns are given or indicated by Daniel in his fourth volume.
The first is a series of quintains, each for one of the canonical
hours. Then the <i>Hymnum dicat turba fratrum</i>, which already
Beda described as <i>hymnus ille pulcherrimus</i>, is found in a mutilated
form in the Antiphonary, and ascribed to Hilary. It is a terse rehearsal
of the facts of our Lord&rsquo;s birth, life, passion, and resurrection.
Daniel suggests that it is one of the primitive hymns of the
martyr-ages of the Church to which Pliny refers, and brought into
Latin from the original Greek by some scholarly Briton or Irish
man. Then a hymn in commemoration of the Apostles (<i>Precamur
Patrem</i>), of which also Daniel thinks that Irish scholarship may
have rendered from the Greek. Then a morning hymn based on
the Constantinopolitan creed (<i>Spiritus divinae lucis gloriae</i>); and
<span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
another in honor of the martyrs (<i>Sacratissimi Martyres summi
Dei</i>); the <i>Lorica</i> of Lathacan; and two hymns in honor of St.
Patrick, one by Sechnall and the other by Fiacc. Daniel gives
only the former, which is an abecedary hymn. Both are full of
the marvellous&mdash;an element not wanting even in the contemporary
documents of Patrick&rsquo;s life, and quite abundant in those of later
date.</p>
<p>Besides these there are four other hymns which Mone has shown
to be of Irish authorship. The first is the <i>Jesus refulsit omnium</i>,
which has been ascribed to Hilary, but is shown not to be his not
only by the rhyme, but by the alliteration which marks it as originating
in the North of Europe. It is found in manuscripts, German
and English, of the eleventh century; but Mone ascribes it
to an Irish author both because of the strophe employed and
because of the mixture of Greek words with the Latin, the Irish
being the best Greek scholars of the West, and being not disinclined
to show off their erudition in this way. Another is an
abecedary hymn, <i>Ad coeli clara non sum dignus sidera</i>, famous as
having been supposed by some stupid critic to be the lost evening
hymn which Hilary sent from the East to his daughter along with
the <i>Lucis largitor splendide</i>. It probably is as old as the sixth or
seventh century, both the structure of the verse and the allusions
to pagan beliefs and Christian heresies indicating that antiquity.
The use of alliteration and other peculiarities indicate an Irish
author, but probably a monk of Bobbio, as the accentuated Sapphic
verse was in use in that country. Here are seven of its most
characteristic stanzas:</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p class="jr">S. W. D.</p>
<p>Besides this we have the <i>Cantemus omni die concenentes variae</i>,
which furnishes a remarkable combination of sustained rhyme with
a free use of alliteration; and two hymns in honor of Michael the
Archangel, of which the first is an abecedary, and has the same
structural peculiarity. Besides these there are other hymns in the
<i>Leabhur Jomann</i>, or &ldquo;Book of Hymns,&rdquo; in honor of St. Brigid
(often confounded with the St. Birgitta of Sweden) and other
Irish saints&mdash;some in Latin and some in Irish. They have been
edited for the Irish Archaeological Society by Dr. J. H. Todd
(Dublin, 1855-69).</p>
<p>To the eighth century, the age of the Iconoclasts, of John of
Damascus and of Beda, we trace but few anonymous hymns. As
we have said, the <i>Urbs beata Hirusalem</i> (with the <i>Angulare fundamentum</i>)
may belong here, and so may some in the Mozarabic
Breviary. But as only the manuscripts we have named and the
&ldquo;Psalter of the Queen of Sweden&rdquo;&mdash;so called because it once
was the property of Queen Christine&mdash;go back to this time, we
can only guess which of the hymns marked as &ldquo;very old&rdquo; in
manuscripts of the eleventh and later centuries date back to this.
Niebuhr found in a tenth-century manuscript the pilgrim hymn
<i>O Roma nobilis, orbis et domina</i>, and published it in the <i>Rheinisches
<span class="pb" id="Page_364">364</span>
Museum</i> (1829), and traced its accentual form of verse back to the
old folk-songs of Rome, such as the Roman soldiers may well
have sung at the triumph of Camillus, and certainly did so behind
the golden triumphal chariots of Caesar and Aurelian.</p>
<p>To this century some ascribe the hymn for martyrs, <i>Sanctorum
meritis inclyta gaudia</i>, which holds its place in a recast in the
Roman Breviary, and has occupied the attention of at least four
English translators. In the history of theology it is memorable as
giving Gottschalk a point by its use of the phrase <i>trina deitas</i>, to
which Archbishop Hincmar strongly objected.</p>
<p>Of the less notable hymn-writers of this century three belong
to the group of literary men whom Charles the Great gathered at
his court or employed in his administration. That Charles
himself was a poet in any sense we have no evidence, much less
that he wrote the <i>Veni, Creator Spiritus</i>. His biographer, Eginhard,
tells us that although he spoke Latin fluently&mdash;his native
language, of course, being German&mdash;he never fully acquired the
art of writing, although he kept a tablet under his pillow for the
sake of practising. He was a keen lover of learning and a generous
patron of education. In one of his trips to Italy he encountered
at Parma an Englishman, chief of the Cathedral school at
York, and then on his way to Rome to obtain the <i>pallium</i> for
Archbishop Eanbald. Charles offered him sufficient inducement
to remove to the Continent, and for fourteen years (782-96)
Alcuin of York (735-804) was Charles&rsquo;s minister of education
and head of the palace school, in which both the king and his
children studied. He was rewarded with various abbacies, and in
796 he retired to one of them&mdash;that of St. Martin at Tours&mdash;withdrawing
from the not very admirable court of his patron to spend
his eight last years in study and devotion. He was succeeded by
an Irishman named Clemens, who brought over the Irish preference
for Greek philosophy, especially that of Plato, to Alcuin&rsquo;s
keen annoyance. In the collections there are some half-dozen
hymns ascribed to Alcuin, none of which have made any marked
impression. He was an honest, plodding, unimaginative Englishman,
such as still writes Latin verses at Eton or Harrow, <i>invit&acirc;
Minerv&acirc;</i>, and as a matter of duty, not of necessity.</p>
<p>More notable for personal qualities was the Lombard, Paul
Warnefried (730-96), better known as Paul the Deacon (<i>Paulus
<span class="pb" id="Page_365">365</span>
Diaconus</i>), who had witnessed the overthrow of the Lombard
kingdom by Charles in 774, and then withdrew to Monte Casino,
where he became a Benedictine monk. He attracted Charles&rsquo;s
attention in 781 by a poetical petition in behalf of his brother
Arichis, who had been carried beyond the Alps as a prisoner; and
the king invited him to his court. He returned to Monte Casino
in 787. His most important work, the <i>De Gestis Longobardorum
Libri Sex</i>, is marked by a lively and patriotic interest in the
legends, habits, and fortunes of his own people. He has preserved
for us much early Teutonic lore, such as the poetical explanation
of the origin of the name &ldquo;Lombard,&rdquo; which Kingsley
has worked into a poem in <i>Hypatia</i>. A Frank he never became,
and the rough soldiers of Charles&rsquo;s court proposed to cut off his
hands and put out his eyes by way of resenting this. &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo;
replied Charles, &ldquo;that I should thus treat so excellent a
poet and a historian.&rdquo; There are but two hymns which bear
Paul Warnefried&rsquo;s name: one in commemoration of John the
Baptist, and the other on the miracles of Benedict of Nursia. The
former, which frequently is divided into three parts for different
services on St. John&rsquo;s day, is a hymn of much merit, and still
holds its place in the Roman Breviary. Its widest fame is in connection
with the history of music, as from its first verse we derive
the ordinary names of our musical notes. The verse runs,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Ut</i> queant laxis</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Re</i>sonare fibris</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Mi</i>ra gestorum</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Fa</i>muli tuorum,</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Sol</i>ve polluti</p>
<p class="t0"><i>La</i>bii reatum,</p>
<p class="t0">Sancte Johannes.</p>
</div>
<p>The tune composed for the hymn in the Middle Ages, or
adapted to it, had the peculiarity that each half verse began on one
of the bars of the staff, and each a note higher than the last. This
suggested, possibly to Guido of Arezzo in the eleventh century,
the possibility of using these first syllables as a mnemonic device to
fix the pitch of each note on the memory of those who were learning
to sing. Guido, in a letter to his friend Michael, describes the
device in terms which suggest that it was his own. But there is
no warrant for the assumption often made in this connection that
he devised the musical staff. That was in use in England as early
as 1016, while Guido wrote about 1067.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_366">366</div>
<p>A third of Charles&rsquo;s <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> was Paulinus, whom he made
patriarch of Aquileia (726-804), and who is specified by George
Cassander as the author of three extant hymns. One of these, the
<i>Refulgit omnia luce mundus aurea</i>, is thought by Mone to belong
to the sixth or seventh century. It is in the ornate style of his
namesake of Nola and his imitator Elpis, so that it may be the
work of the older Paulinus. It possesses a philological interest as
being written in the <i>lingua rustica</i>, or provincial and countrified
Latin, out of which the Romance languages were developed.
Paulinus of Aquileia was a German, who took an active part in
the controversies of his times, as may be seen from his prose
works. Walafrid Strabo in the next century speaks of him as a
hymn-writer; but it is impossible to say how many, if any, of the
hymns which stand in his name are his work.</p>
<p>The ninth century is much more fertile in hymns than either
the seventh or the eighth. It is the age of Charles the Great as
Emperor, of Rabanus Maurus and Hincmar, and of John Scotus
Erigena; and it witnessed the founding of the school of sequence-singers
at St. Gall. To this century has been traced the beautiful
paschal sequence <i>Victimae paschali laudes immolent Christiani</i>, one
of the few which hold their place in the Roman Missal. Kehrein,
on what seems to him good authority, ascribes the sequence to
Wipo, the Burgundian chaplain of the Emperor Conrad II., and
the tutor of Henry II., who has left us several poems on historical
events of his time, besides a prose life of Conrad and two didactic
poems for the edification of Henry. He was a man of unusual
acquaintance with classical literature, which probably led to his
selection as tutor to the young prince. All this makes Kehrein&rsquo;s
ascription of the sequence to him have an air of probability, which,
however, is weakened, if not destroyed, by a comparison of this
with his undoubted poems. These employ both the classic hexameter
and the rhymed verse of his own age; but in neither does
he show the fine ear for rhythm which the author of the <i>Victimae
paschali laudes</i> must have possessed. The sequence was one of
those Easter hymns in which Luther took such delight, and which
he describes in general terms in his <i>House-Postill</i>: &ldquo;In the time of
popery many fine hymns were sung! He that broke up hell,
and overcame the very Devil therein, therewith the Lord redeemed
his Christendom.&rdquo; Elsewhere in the same book he calls this &ldquo;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_367">367</span>
very beautiful hymn,&rdquo; especially finding delight in the second
verse, <i>Mors et Vita duello conflixere mirando: Dux vitae mortuus
regnat vivus</i>. &ldquo;Make it who will, he must have had a high and
Christian understanding to have painted this picture with such fine
gracefulness.&rdquo; In his commentary on Hosea, he again quotes it
with especial praise.</p>
<p>To this ninth century Koch assigns the <i>Virginis proles opifexque
matris</i>, which still holds its place in the Roman Breviary in a revised
form. Less offensive to Protestant ears is the brief and
beautiful sequence, probably of this century, <i>Quod chorus vatum</i>,
which Mr. Blew has translated for his <i>Church Hymn and Tune-Book</i>
(1855), and the editor of the <i>Lyra Messianica</i> has copied.
Here also belongs the <i>Ad Dominum clamaveram</i>, which is one of
the earliest attempts at a metrical treatment of the Psalms. It
consists largely of extracts from the fifteen Psalms of Degrees.
Here also belongs the <i>Iste confessor Domini</i>, which still holds its
place in the Roman Breviary.</p>
<p>Of the less-known hymn-writers we may name the younger
Prudentius, who, like his greater namesake, was a Spaniard by
birth, his family probably being one of the many which took
refuge in France from the rule of the Saracens. Indeed, he assumed
the name out of compliment to the elder poet&mdash;a practice
very reprehensible in the eyes of hymnologists, as increasing the
amply sufficient confusion which hangs around the identity of
hymn-writers. He was one of the most learned men of his time,
and had the manliness to defend the Augustinian doctrine of predestination
against Hincmar of Rheims, at the time when Gottschalk
had brought it into ill repute by his paradoxical statement
of it. But he and Hincmar found common ground in opposing
John Scotus Erigena, who asserted that the whole controversy
grew out of the ascription of temporal existence to the divine and
eternal mind. His hymns are lost to us, those ascribed to him
being certainly not of his authorship, unless perhaps the <i>Virgo
Dei genetrix</i>.</p>
<p>Servatus Lupus (805-63), abbot of Ferri&egrave;res, was one of the
many pupils of Rabanus Maurus, who rose to eminence in the
Church of this age, and were employed by the Karling kings in
public affairs. His best monument is his letters, which give us a
vivid picture of a time of disorder, and of a man of genuine capacity
<span class="pb" id="Page_368">368</span>
and honest purpose. His hymns in praise of St. Wigbert are
of less worth.</p>
<p>Much more important is Theodulph of Orleans (<i>ob.</i> 821), the
author of a single hymn, which has preserved his memory not less
by its own merits than by its association with a beautiful but unhistorical
legend of its authorship. He, too, was of Spanish birth
and Gothic stock. He was honored and trusted by Charles the
Great, and was one of the witnesses to his will. He was strongly
imperialist in his politics, both before and after Charles&rsquo;s death
opposing the inevitable separation of France from Germany, especially
in his poems to Charles and his sons, which are among the
best of that age. In 818, however, he was implicated justly or
unjustly in the rebellion of Bernard, King of Italy, against his
uncle the emperor, and was imprisoned three years. While in
prison he composed, tradition says, the hymn for Palm Sunday,
<i>Gloria, laus et honor</i>, together with other poems, as the pastime of
weary hours. The story runs that it was to the hymn he owed his
liberation. On Palm Sunday of 821 the Emperor Lewis the Pious
was at Angers, where the Bishop of Orleans was imprisoned in a
monastery. Through an open window, when the emperor was
within hearing, he sang the hymn, which so moved his heart that he
gave orders to set the prisoner at liberty. Another version of the
story is that he had taught it to the children of the church, who
sang it before the emperor. The legend is discredited by the fact
that in 821 there was a general amnesty for political offenders,
which must have given him his liberty. He died within the year,
by poison it is said.</p>
<p>To make the list complete we add the names of Ermanrich
(<i>ob.</i> 840), abbot of Ellwangen in W&uuml;rtemberg; Drepanius Florus
(<i>ob.</i> 860), deacon of the church of Lyons; Eric, a monk at Saint-Germain
at Auxerre, and Paul Alvarez of Cordova (<i>ob.</i> 861)&mdash;all
of whom have left us hymns in commemoration of saints.</p>
<p>In the chapter on Notker a full account has been given of the
three principal singers of St. Gall&mdash;Notker Balbulus, Tutilo, and
Hartmann. There are two lesser sequence-writers of that monastery
who belong to the same (ninth) century&mdash;Ratpert and Waltram.
Ratpert (<i>ob.</i> 900), like Notker, was a pupil of the Irishman
M&ouml;ngal. He was of noble family and born in the neighborhood
of Zurich, and made such proficiency that he was entrusted with
<span class="pb" id="Page_369">369</span>
the oversight of the outer school at St. Gall. His &ldquo;proses&rdquo; were
composed especially for processional use and for pilgrimages, and
therefore are not sequences in the strict sense. To adapt them to
this use he fitted them with refrains, which might be caught up
by those who had little familiarity with Latin. The <i>Rex sanctorum
angelorum</i> is the best known of them. But most important
is his position as the first in point of time of the German hymn-writers.
He wrote a German hymn in honor of St. Gall (<i>fecit
carmen barbaricum populo in laude Sancti Galli canendum</i>), of which
unfortunately we have only Ekkehard&rsquo;s Latin translation, made a
century later.</p>
<p>Waltram never rose above the rank of deacon at St. Gall. He
was more famous for his poems on secular themes, written to the
music of the sequences, than for sequences proper. But one of
the latter is ascribed to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_370">370</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><span class="small">THE UNKNOWN AND THE LESS KNOWN HYMN-WRITERS.
<br />[Tenth to Sixteenth Century.]</span></h2>
<p>The tenth century&mdash;the century of the Danes, of the Normans,
of the Othos, of the Olafs, of Dunstan, and of Cordova as a centre
of philosophic and scientific culture&mdash;saw the general establishment
of Christianity among the Teutonic peoples of Northern
Europe. It was not rich in great Churchmen, great men of letters,
or great hymn-writers. We find in it no name great enough to
deserve a separate chapter. Yet Odo of Cluny and Fulbert of
Chartres, the two Ekkehards, and Rupert of St. Gall are enough
to show that it was not altogether barren.</p>
<p>This dark age was a time when the worship of Mary and
the saints, already on the increase in previous ages, made rapid
advances. The practice of formal canonization of the saints
dates from 993. Perhaps the most characteristic hymn of the
century is the <i>Ave Maris stella</i>, which has been ascribed to Venantius
Fortunatus of the sixth century, but cannot be older than the
tenth. Daniel&rsquo;s final judgment was that a St. Gall <span class="small">MS.</span> proves it
to belong here, although he formerly had thought it might be as
early as the sixth century. Moll and Mone, however, would put
it even later, on the theory that it borrows from one of Hermann
of Reichenau&rsquo;s sequences. It is one of the favorite hymns of the
Roman Catholic Church, being found in all the breviaries, and
assigned for use not only at the Annunciation, to which it properly
belongs, but to others of the many festivals in honor of our Lord&rsquo;s
mother. In the following version Mr. Duffield has given the easy
form of the original:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hail, thou star of ocean,</p>
<p class="t">God&rsquo;s own mother mortal,</p>
<p class="t0">Virgin ever perfect,</p>
<p class="t">Heaven&rsquo;s own blessed portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_371">371</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bright with such a message,</p>
<p class="t">Gabriel gave thee greeting;</p>
<p class="t0">Grant us, then, thy favor,</p>
<p class="t">Eve&rsquo;s defeat defeating.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Loose the prisoner&rsquo;s bondage,</p>
<p class="t">Give the blind their vision,</p>
<p class="t0">Drive all evils from us,</p>
<p class="t">Pray for our condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Show thyself our mother,</p>
<p class="t">Let thy prayer avail us</p>
<p class="t0">With thy Son, our Saviour,</p>
<p class="t">Born that naught should fail us.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Virgin pure and only,</p>
<p class="t">Mild among all others,</p>
<p class="t0">Make us free from sinning,</p>
<p class="t">Meek beyond our brothers.</p>
</div>
<p>To this century or later we must assign the <i>Martyr Dei qui unicum</i>,
which (as <i>Invicte Martyr unicum</i>) still holds its place in the
Roman Breviary; and the <i>Jesu Redemptor omnium</i>, which is similarly honored.</p>
<p>Odo of Cluny (879-943) is the first of the three poets who have
adorned that famous monastic house. He was dedicated before
his birth to St. Martin, by his father, a courtier of the Duke of
Aquitaine, and became a monk at Tours in fulfilment of this vow.
He got such education as the times furnished, going to Paris for
the sake of finding the best schools. He then joined the congregation
of three monasteries recently founded by Bernon, who was
abbot of them all. At the death of Bernon he became the second
abbot of Cluny, and it speaks ill for either Bernon or the age that
he found his work to be that of a monastic reformer even in a
young monastery. He was the most considerable figure in the
French Church of his time, and his advice and mediation were
sought on all sides. As his name was a very usual one, a long
series of books he did not write has been fathered on him, what
he really left being a collection of addresses to his monks (<i>Collationes</i>),
some sermons, and a few hymns, about four in all. Of
these Dr. Neale has translated the <i>Lauda, mater ecclesiae, lauda
Christi</i>, and Mr. Chambers the <i>Aeterni Patris unice</i>. They commemorate
<span class="pb" id="Page_372">372</span>
Mary Magdalene, identifying her, of course, with Mary
of Bethany, as Church tradition does.</p>
<p>Fulbert of Chartres (950-1028) was to France, in the second
half of this century of disorder and transition, what Odo was in the
first. He also was from Aquitaine, and possibly of a noble family,
although he seems to contradict his biographers on that point
when he says,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t5">&ldquo;non opibus nec sanguine fretus</p>
<p class="t0">Conscendi cathedram, pauper, de sorde levatus.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He studied at Rheims under the great scholar Gerbert, afterward
Pope Sylvester II.&mdash;&ldquo;a pope,&rdquo; as Dr. D&ouml;llinger says, &ldquo;who
was held in great honor as the most learned scholar and the most
enlightened spirit of his time,&rdquo; but afterward was regarded as an
expert in the black art, and even as having sold himself to Satan.
From him Fulbert at least learned no black arts. Transferred in
968 to Chartres as chancellor of the cathedral, with charge of its
school, he made the place a centre of attraction to students from
three nations. His scholars called him &ldquo;the Frankish Socrates,&rdquo;
and frequent is the reference in writers of the next generation to
the delightful fellowship they had with this bright-minded and
devout master, who taught the science of both natural and divine
things, entering into right human relations with each of them,
and pointing them to that knowledge which is life eternal. Even
after Robert II. elevated him to the bishopric of Chartres, in 1007,
he found time to take part in the work of teaching, which he so
much loved. He died in 1028.</p>
<p>His letters are his chief monument, and they give us an unattractive
picture of his age. One of them denounces bishops who
have become soldiers as unworthy of the name. Others tell of the
murder, in the very porch of the cathedral, of a priest he had made
the sub-dean of the cathedral at Sens. The friends of a rival
candidate killed him, with the alleged connivance of the bishop of
Sens! In yet another he takes to task Constance, the shrew
whom a just Providence awarded to Robert II. as his last wife.
His sermons are less notable, and much given to Mariolatry. His
hymns are few in number, but one of them, the <i>Chorus novae
Hirusalem</i>, is a Whitsunday hymn of much beauty, yet it has not
commended itself to the compilers of the Roman Breviary. Mone
remarks that it unites classic metre with rhyme, which is true also
<span class="pb" id="Page_373">373</span>
of his hymn in commemoration of Martin of Tours, <i>Inter patres
monachalis</i>.</p>
<p>The fifth abbot of Cluny, Odilo (962-1048), was a dear friend of
Fulbert&rsquo;s, and lamented his death. He continued the work of
monastic reform begun by Odo, which made Cluny the centre of
monastic energy and life in this age. Especially was the severity
of the restored rule of Benedict, as practised at Cluny, opposed to
the laxer order established by the Irish monks in Germany. So
absorbed was he in this work that he refused to be made Archbishop
of Lyons. Fulbert called him &ldquo;the archangel of the
monks.&rdquo; He also wrote hymns, but there are none that we can
attach with certainty to his name.</p>
<p>The same is true of Salvus, abbot of a cloister in the Christian
kingdom of Navarre. Heriger, abbot of Lobbes (940-1009), a
Flemish Benedictine and hagiologist, of great renown as an educator
and a scholar, has left one hymn, <i>Ave per quam</i>, and two antiphons,
in honor of the Apostle Thomas. Theodoric of Monte
Casino wrote a hymn in honor of St. Maurus.</p>
<p>To the eleventh century we owe the beginnings of many things&mdash;rag
paper, Gothic architecture, our modern musical notation, the
crusades, the troubadours, the peace of God, the Norman rule in
England. It is the century of Hildebrand, of Peter Damiani, of
Anselm of Canterbury, of the great struggle to establish the celibacy
of the clergy and to abolish lay patronage in the Church. It
is not rich in hymn-writers, but it has some minor names and
anonymous hymns worthy of notice.</p>
<p>To this century belongs the manuscript collection of old English
hymns in Latin which the Rev. Joseph Stevenson edited for the
Surtees Society in 1851 (<i>Latin Hymns of the Anglo-Saxon
Church, with an Interlinear Saxon Gloss. From a manuscript of
the Eleventh Century in Durham Library</i>). While many of them
are found equally in the breviaries and hymnaries of the Continent,
there is a large number which seem to be peculiar to the
English Church, and have not been traced to any continental
source. None of these are very great hymns, and their importance
to us is partly from our interest in the work of our English ancestors,
and partly from the preference shown to them by modern
English translators. But such work as <i>Annis peractis mensibus</i> and
<i>Nuntium nobis fero de supernis</i> is more than respectable. In this
<span class="pb" id="Page_374">374</span>
manuscript is found the beautiful hymn for Septuagesima and succeeding
Sundays, <i>Alleluia, dulce carmen</i>, which therefore may be an
old English hymn. It was written in accordance with the old
usage that &ldquo;Alleluia!&rdquo; should be sung frequently on that and the
following Sundays in preparation for Lent. To this century Koch
assigns the abecedarian hymn, <i>A patre unigenitus</i>, which gets
almost through the alphabet in twenty lines, but is better than
this would indicate, or Mr. Chambers would not have translated
it. Here belongs the <i>Audi, tellus, audi</i>, which unfortunately is
only partly preserved in its original and unexpanded form. It is
a judgment hymn, but not one of the greatest. The Lutherans
used it for some time after the Reformation, and Dr. Washburn
has translated it. The enlarged form recalls the <i>Cur mundus militat</i>
of Jacoponus. Du M&eacute;ril has published a Christmas hymn of
this century, <i>Congaudeat turba fidelium</i>, whose first six verses indicate
its popular use by their refrain, &ldquo;In Bethlehem!&rdquo; It bears a
close resemblance to many of the fifteenth century, and may have
been their model. To the same editor we owe the terse and
spirited Easter hymn of this same century, <i>Mitis agnus, leo fortis</i>,
which has found several English translators. To this century or,
at latest, to the next, we must assign the very beautiful hymn in
commemoration of Stephen the Protomartyr, <i>Sancte Dei pretiose</i>,
whose popularity seems to have made it especially tempting to the
hymn-tinkers of the Middle Ages. It is found in two other forms,
both of them much watered; &ldquo;but nobody likes inspiration and
water,&rdquo; as Lowell says.</p>
<p>To Anselm of Canterbury, the great archbishop and theologian,
seven hymns are assigned in the collections. They are so much
below the level of the <i>Cur Deus Homo</i>, the <i>Monologion</i>, and the
<i>Prosologion</i> of that great master, as to suggest that they are the
work of one of the lesser Anselms&mdash;for the name was a common
one in that age&mdash;and that they have been assigned to him by the
eagerness of his editors to swell his works, as has been done with
many prose treatises. One of the best is a long &ldquo;Prayer to the
Lord and all His Saints,&rdquo; beginning <i>Deus, pater credentium</i>, of
which Mr. Duffield says, in a manuscript note, that it &ldquo;contains
many excellent stanzas.&rdquo; There is another, &ldquo;To Mary and all
the Saints,&rdquo; nearly as long, which shows the author&rsquo;s training in a
French school by its use of the assonance. Yet another on Mary
<span class="pb" id="Page_375">375</span>
alone&mdash;<i>Lux quae luces in tenebris</i>&mdash;which has been broken into
eight brief hymns for the canonical hours. Christ as the Son and
Mary herself are invoked in alternate verses.</p>
<p>Better than any of these is a little hymn which is his in the sense
of being based on a fine passage of his prose meditations. This
&ldquo;second Augustine,&rdquo; like the first, was happier as an occasion of
poetry in other men, than in his own verses. Here it is:</p>

<p>Another Anselm of this century is the Bishop of Lucca, who
died 1086, and to whom is ascribed a long meditative poem on
our Lord&rsquo;s life, in a kind of rhymed verse which is much more frequently
met in the narrative or humorous poems of the next century,
called Goliardic. It does not belong to the lyric poetry of
the Church, although a spirited hymn has been extracted by Herbert
Kynaston from the passage given by Trench. (See <i>Lyra
Messianica</i>, pp. 283, 284.) Anselm was a weak man caught in
the storm of the controversy over investitures, and would have
<span class="pb" id="Page_376">376</span>
ended his days as a monk of Cluny, if Gregory VII. had not forbidden
him. It is said that, although he had written in defence
of the claims of Gregory against the anti-pope Guibert, he finally
joined Guibert&rsquo;s party before his death.</p>
<p>Godefroy or Geofroy, Abbot of Vendome, is another hymn-writer
who was mixed up in that controversy, but remained
steadfast on the papal side. He belongs both to this and the next
century, having been made abbot in 1094, and lived on till 1129 at
least. Twelve times he crossed the Alps in the interest of the
papacy, and was rewarded for his zeal by a cardinalate. His letters
still preserve for us the picture of a zealous ultramontane
churchman; but his four &ldquo;proses&rdquo;&mdash;one about our Lord&rsquo;s
mother and three on Mary Magdalene&mdash;are of less importance.</p>
<p>To Heribert (<i>ob.</i> 1042), Bishop of Eichstetten, in modern Baden
(anciently part of Swabia), Migne (<i>Patrologia</i>, 141) ascribes a
number of hymns, which previously had borne no other name in
the collections. His dominant tendency as a hymn-writer is
shown by the fact that he wrote five hymns beginning <i>Ave Maria,
gratia plena</i>, none of which, however, is the well-known hymn
beginning with those words. That belongs to a later century.
The best of his hymns are that to all saints, <i>Omnes superni ordines</i>,
and that to the cross, <i>Salve crux sancta, salve mundi gloria</i>, of
which Prior Aylward has furnished a spirited version to Mr.
Shipley&rsquo;s <i>Annus Sanctus</i>. Of the author we can learn nothing
more than his date and location.</p>
<p>The succession of sequence-writers in Southern Germany was
kept up through this century by Gottschalk and the fourth Ekkehard
of St. Gall. Of Gottschalk we know little more than that
he studied under a master, Heinrich, in an unnamed monastery
of South Germany, to whom Schubiger (<i>Die S&auml;ngerschule St.
Gallens</i>, 1858) assigns the <i>Ave praeclara Maris stella</i> (see <a class="pgref" href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>),
on the authority of a manuscript he believes to be older than Hermann
Contractus. Of Gottschalk&rsquo;s own sequences there are but
three which certainly are his, and they all are prosy. If he and
not some French Gottschalk of this century be the author of the
<i>O Deus, miseri misereri servi</i>, which Daniel (IV., 173) copies from
Du M&eacute;ril, it is better than any of his sequences. Du M&eacute;ril inclines
to ascribe it to the Gottschalk of the ninth century, whom
we met in the history of Rabanus Maurus. Ekkehard IV. is
<span class="pb" id="Page_377">377</span>
memorable only for his Latin version of the German hymn by
Ratpert in honor of St. Gall, of which the original is lost.</p>
<p>The twelfth century is that of the great Crusades, of Bernard
and Abelard, and Peter the Venerable, and Hildebert and Adam
of St. Victor. The age also of Thomas Becket, Peter Lombard,
and Saladin. The Civil Law was rediscovered at Amalfi; the
Canon Law digested by Gratian; the age-long conflict of Guelphs
and Ghibellines began, to end only with the political ruin of Germany
and the dismemberment of the Empire.</p>
<p>It was a time of great intellectual activity in Western Europe.
The universities took their rise now, although not known by that
name till the next century. In the national literatures of France
and Germany it was the springtime of a new age&mdash;the age of the
troubadours and the trouv&egrave;res, of the Minnesingers, and the popular
romances. In Latin hymnology no century was more fertile
in great things than this.</p>
<p>Of the anonymous hymns traced to this century there are several
of great beauty. The hymn on the Apostles, <i>Exultet coelum laudibus</i>,
holds its place in the Roman Breviary in a much diluted revision.
It shows a close study of Scripture and great command
of terse expression. The Easter hymn, <i>Finita jam sunt praelia</i>,
generally is given with a double Alleluia prefixed. Daniel refers it
to this century; Neale to the next. It is known to English
readers by the versions of Rev. Francis Pott (&ldquo;The strife is o&rsquo;er,
the victory won!&rdquo;) and of Dr. Neale (&ldquo;Finished is the battle
now&rdquo;), both of great merit. Exactly the same difference of
authorities we find as to the date of the <i>O filii et filiae</i>, another
Easter hymn of great beauty and still more honored by the preferences
of the translators, but ignored by the collectors, Professor
March excepted. The Passion hymn, <i>Patris Sapientia, veritas
divina</i>, has been bandied about among many supposed authors,
two popes of the fourteenth century included. It is in the &ldquo;Goliardic&rdquo;
metre we find in Anselm of Lucca, which was widely used
in the satirical poetry of this century. It therefore probably belongs
here, and may be the work of the &ldquo;Egidius Episcopus&rdquo; specified
in one copy of the hymn. A third Easter hymn, the <i>Surrexit
Christe hodie</i>, may be as old as this century, as there is a German
hymn of this century which borrows from it, <i>Christus ist erstanden</i>.
In its Latin, indeed, lies the germ of many later Easter hymns,
<span class="pb" id="Page_378">378</span>
including that of Charles Wesley, &ldquo;Christ the Lord is risen to-day.&rdquo;
It is itself the simplest and truest expansion of the Easter
morning greeting of the early Christian Church, when its members,
as they met each other on the street on that Sunday, substituted
&ldquo;Christ is risen!&rdquo; for the usual &ldquo;Peace be with you!&rdquo; That
was the word of confession by which the Church&rsquo;s Easter joy in
the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, the spiritual
springtide over spiritual winter, was proclaimed to a joyless and
despairing world.</p>
<p>To this century also belongs the Advent sequence, <i>Veni, veni
Emmanuel!</i> So Dr. Neale thinks, but Professor Daniel hesitates.
It undoubtedly is based on the eight &ldquo;Greater Antiphons,&rdquo; which
were sung at the Vesper service on the eight days preceding Christmas
(<i>O Sapientia</i>, etc.), of which a metrical version by Lord Nelson
and others is in the Hymnal of the Episcopal Church. At
least as old as this century is the very beautiful sequence on the
life of Christ, <i>In sapientia disponens omnia</i>, which Mone found in a
<span class="small">MS.</span> of this century, and Trend (<i>Lyra Mystica</i>) and Crippen have
translated. The two halves of the sequence differ in a marked
way in their metrical structure.</p>
<p>Of the lesser hymn-writers of the century, Marbod is the most
productive. Like Fulbert and Odilo, he might as well be credited
to the last century as to this. He was the son of a fur dealer at
Angers, named Robert, became Bishop of Rennes, and died a
monk at St. Aubin in 1123. He had the fighting qualities of the
Angevins, whose churches are full of the tombs not of saints, but
of armed warriors, Michelet says. He took such an active and
aggressive part in a dispute over the election of a bishop of Angers
that the other party made him their prisoner and carried him out
of the <i>m&eacute;l&eacute;e</i>. But it was his eminence as a Latin poet for which
his age most valued him. When he died the monks of St. Aubin
announced the fact in a circular letter, and Ulger, Bishop of
Angers, anticipated the extravagance of Dryden&rsquo;s epigram on
Milton in his praises of his friend:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Cessit ei Cicero, cessit Maro</p>
<p class="t5">Junctus Homero.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Beaugendre in 1708 collected his poems and published them along
with those of his contemporary, Hildebert of Tours. They are
<span class="pb" id="Page_379">379</span>
mostly versified legends of the saints, with a long poem, <i>De Gemmis</i>,
interesting and curious as showing the &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; associations
of the mediaeval mind with precious stones. From this Mone gives
the interpretation of the precious stones in the heavenly Jerusalem,
beginning <i>Cives coelestis patriae</i>. More hymn like in character is
the <i>Deus-Homo rex coelorum</i>, which Chancellor Benedict has translated
from Trench&rsquo;s anthology:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Deus-Homo, Rex coelorum,</p>

<p>There are two notable sequences attributed to the nun Hildegard
of Bingen (1104-78), a visionary and prophetess who commanded
the respect of Bernard and his pupil, Pope Eugenius, by
her castigations of the disorders of Christendom, as did Birgitta of
Sweden and Catherine of Sienna in a later period. There is extant
a letter of hers to Bernard, written during his visit to Germany
to preach the second crusade, in which she explains in very imperfect
Latin the nature of her gift. Her life was begun by Gottfried
and finished by Theodorich, monk of Trier. A comparison of
her works&mdash;the <i>Scivias</i> and the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i>&mdash;with the
letter to Bernard on the one hand, and Theodorich&rsquo;s part of the
biography on the other, makes it very evident that the monk wrote
her works as well as her life; and how much of her genuine
prophecies he worked into them we are unable to say. It therefore
is not decisive as to her authorship that the <i>O ignis Spirit&ucirc;s
Paracliti</i> and the <i>O virga ac diadema</i> are found in the manuscripts
<span class="pb" id="Page_380">380</span>
of her works, and that Theodorich vouches for the former. The
author of these sequences had no acquaintance with the metrical
principles of the school of St. Gall, and seems to have taken the
Latin psalter as a model. Dr. Littledale, in his version of the
former, substitutes a stricter metrical form.</p>
<p>Pierre de Corbeil was successively teacher of theology at Paris&mdash;where
he had Innocent III. among his pupils&mdash;Bishop of Cambray,
and in 1200 Archbishop of Sens. Innocent employed him
on important missions, and he was a man of note in the Church
and State of his age. A manuscript still preserved in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale of Paris contains a satire on married men which
is ascribed to him (<i>Satyra adversus eos qui Uxores ducunt</i>). But
it is a very different kind of poem which entitles him to mention
here, his hymn</p>

<p>Pietro Gonella, a Franciscan monk of Tortona in Piedmont, is
the reputed author of a long meditative poem on the miseries and
follies of life and the certainty of death and judgment, which Du
M&eacute;ril found in a manuscript of this century. If he be not mistaken
as to the date of the manuscript, of course, Eug. de Levis
(<i>Anecdota Sacra</i>, Turin, 1789) is wrong in ascribing it to Pietro,
as there were no Franciscans in the twelfth century. The chronology
is important because of the relation of the poem to the <i>Dies
Irae</i>. In point of metrical form they differ only in this <i>Heu!
Heu! mala mundi vita</i> (better known as the <i>Cum revolvo toto corde</i>,
from the opening line of its second part), having four lines to the
verse instead of three. In point of sense the resemblances are so
striking as to suggest that Thomas of Celano has ploughed with
the heifer of his earlier countryman. In proof of this take these
stanzas:</p>

</div>
<p>If nothing whatever had been known as to the date of the two
poems, we should have pronounced this an expansion of the <i>Dies
irae, dies illa</i> by a later poet, who had two objects in view: the
first, to sharpen to the conscience of his readers the warnings of
the impending judgment; the second, to complete the poem by
bringing the joys of the judgment more prominently into view.
And with all respect for Edelestand du M&eacute;ril&rsquo;s judgment, we would
like to have more light on the date of his manuscript.</p>
<p>A manuscript still preserved at Liege in Belgium contains the
letters of Guido of Basoches, which is either Bas-oha, a village
near that city, or, as Mone thinks, a place near Ch&acirc;teaudun in
France. Among these letters are given a number of hymns,
which he sends to his correspondents. They show some power of
versification, but nothing more, and are defaced by conceits and
puns. Thus he puts the name of Stephen through the six cases
of the Latin grammar in as many verses of a hymn.</p>
<p>There are five writers of this century, each of whom is credited
with a single hymn. Rudolph of Radegg, a schoolmaster of
Einsiedeln, wrote a hymn in honor of St. Meinrad, which begins
<i>Nunc devota silva tota</i>. To Thomas Becket is ascribed the <i>Gaude
Virgo, Mater Christi, Quia...</i>. It is said to be his in a manuscript
of the fifteenth century. To another Englishman, Bertier,
is ascribed the only Latin hymn in the collections which relates
directly to the Crusades, <i>Juxta Threnos Jeremiae</i>. It first appears
in the chronicle of Roger of Hoveden, with the statement that
Bertier wrote it in 1188. Last is Aelred (1104-66), who seems to
have been a lowland Scotchman by birth, and to have shared the
education of Henry, son of King David of Scotland. King
David wished to make him a bishop, but he preferred the life of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_383">383</span>
monk. He made his way to the Cistercian monastery at Rievaulx
in Yorkshire (not Revesby in Lincolnshire, as some say), and
there spent his days, becoming abbot in 1146. That he was a
most lovable man we must infer from his sermons to his monks.
He is one of the few preachers in Dr. Neale&rsquo;s <i>Mediaeval Preachers
and Preaching</i> (London, 1856), of whom we wish for more. His
epitaph likens him, among others, to Bernard of Clairvaux, and the
comparison is apposite. He was an English Bernard, with less
personal force and grasp of intellect, but with the same gentleness
and friendliness. His one hymn is the <i>Pax concordat universa</i>,
which is found in his works, but not in any of the collections.
The theme is congenial.</p>
<p>The thirteenth century, the century of Francis and Dominic,
of Aquinas and Bonaventura, of Thomas of Celano and Jacoponus,
is the age of the giants.</p>
<p>Its anonymous hymns worthy of special mention are few in
number. One of the most beautiful is the Easter hymn, <i>Cedit
frigus hiemale</i>, in which the coincidence of Easter with spring
furnishes the starting-point. It is probably French. The <i>Ave
quem desidero</i> is a rosary hymn, which rehearses our Lord&rsquo;s life,
with a verse for each of the beads, which surely is better than the
usual <i>Ave Marias</i>. The use of rosaries is very ancient&mdash;pre-Christian
even&mdash;but it was with the rise of the Dominican Order
in this century that it became a sanctioned practice. The <i>Jesu
Salvator seculi</i> and the <i>O Trinitas laudabilis</i> have been traced no
further back than to this age; but they preserve the tone and
style of the school of Ambrose. So the <i>Mysteriorum signifer</i>, in
honor of the Archangel Michael, recalls an earlier age, while the
<i>Jesu dulce medicamen</i> suggests the school of Bernard. This
beautiful hymn has both thoughtfulness and unction to commend
it. It represents the sounder tradition of Christian teaching in the
mediaeval Church, and has been neglected unduly by Protestant
translators. Mr. Crippen is the only one who has rendered it,
and also the <i>Juste judex Jesu Christe</i>, a hymn of the same age and
much the same character. Notable Marian hymns are the <i>Gaude
virgo, stella Maris</i>, <i>Salve porta chrystallina</i>, and the <i>Verbum bonum
et suave</i>; with which may be named that to St. John, <i>Verbum Dei
Deo natum</i>, often ascribed to Adam of St. Victor, and certainly of
his school. Also of that school is the vigorous hymn in commemoration
<span class="pb" id="Page_384">384</span>
of St. Paul, <i>Paulus Sion architecta</i>. We add the terse
and forceful hymn in commemoration of Augustine of Hippo,
<i>Salve pater Augustine</i>, and the still finer in commemoration of the
martyrs of the Church, <i>O beata beatorum martyrum certamina</i>,
which has found translators in both Dr. Neale and Mr. Chambers.
It is defective, as making them and not Christ the central
theme.</p>
<p>St. Edmund, the archbishop who gave up the see of Canterbury
because his heart was broken between the demands of the Pope
and the exactions of the king, and died (1240) an exile in a
French monastery, is credited with two Marian hymns, one of
which is a &ldquo;psalter,&rdquo; or hymn of one hundred and fifty stanzas.
They are not of great importance. Another is ascribed to Robert
Grosstete, Bishop of Lincoln (died 1253), one of the great Churchmen
who spoke the truth to the see of Rome. He was the
friend of Simon de Montfort and of the Friars, and the foremost
Churchman of England in his time, as zealous for the reformation
of the clergy of his diocese and the maintenance of the Church&rsquo;s
rights against the King as for its relative independence of the
Roman curia. The <i>Ave Dei genetrix</i> ascribed to him exists only
in a revised and not improved shape. Its twelve verses each begin
with a word from the angelic salutation. The author seems to
have borrowed from a hymn of Peter Damiani.</p>
<p>To Hugo, a Dominican monk, who was Bishop of Strasburg
toward the close of the century, and had taught theology with success,
is ascribed the <i>Ave mundi domina</i>, in which Mary is greeted
as a fiddle&mdash;<i>Ave dulcis figella</i>!</p>
<p>The fourteenth century, like the seventh, furnishes us with the
name of not a single hymn-writer of real eminence, and of very
few who are not eminent. Yet this century and the next exceed
all others in the number of the hymns, which either certainly were
written in this age, or can be traced no farther back. But the
quality falls short as the quantity increases. Mary and the saints
are the favorite themes; and those two great repositories of perverted
praise, the second and third volumes of Mone&rsquo;s collection,
bear emphatic witness to the extent to which the hierarchy of saints
and angels had come to eclipse the splendors of the White Throne
and even of the Cross. There is not a single hymn of the highest
rank which we can ascribe to these centuries of decay, when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_385">385</span>
Middle Ages were passing to their death, to make way for the New
Learning and the Reformation. But the great revival, which first
swept over Italy and then reached Germany about 1470, which
showed its power in the revival of &ldquo;strict observance&rdquo; in the
mendicant orders, in the multiplication of new devotions and pilgrimages,
and the accumulation of relics&mdash;that revival which laid
such a powerful grasp on young Martin Luther and made a monk
of him&mdash;bore abundant fruit in hymns both in Latin and the
vernacular languages. It is a sign of the new age that the language
consecrated by Church use no longer has a monopoly of
hymn-writing, but men begin to praise as well as to hear in their
own tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>
<p>The reverence for the Virgin reaches its height in the <i>Te Matrem
laudamus</i> and the <i>Veni, praecelsa domina</i>, parodies of the <i>Te Deum</i>
and the <i>Veni, sancte Spiritus</i>, which have nothing but ingenuity
and offensiveness to commend them to Protestant readers. Of
genuine poetical merit are the <i>Regina coeli laetare</i> and <i>Stella maris,
O Maria</i>. Of the deluge of hymns in commemoration of the
saints, we notice only the <i>Nardus spirat in odorem</i>, which indicates
the growing worship of our Lord&rsquo;s grandmother, by which Luther
was captivated; the <i>Collaudemus Magdalena</i> of the Sarum Breviary,
which Daniel calls &ldquo;a very sweet hymn&rdquo; (<i>suavissimus hymnus</i>).
From it is extracted the <i>Unde planctus et lamentum</i>, of which Mr.
Duffield has made the following translation. Both Mr. Chambers
and Mr. Morgan have translated the whole hymn.</p>
<h3>UNDE PLANCTUS ET LAMENTUM.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whence this sighing and lamenting?</p>
<p class="t">Why not lift thy heart above?</p>
<p class="t0">Why art thou to signs consenting,</p>
<p class="t">Knowing not whom thou dost love?</p>
<p class="t0">Seek for Jesus! Thy repenting</p>
<p class="t">Shall obtain what none might prove.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whence this groaning and this weeping?</p>
<p class="t">For the purest joy is thine;</p>
<p class="t0">In thy breast thy secret keeping</p>
<p class="t">Of a balm, lest thou repine;</p>
<p class="t0">Hidden there whilst thou art reaping</p>
<p class="t">Barren care for peace divine.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
<p>In the <i>Spe mercede et corona</i> we have the Churchly view of
Thomas Becket&rsquo;s career and its bloody end; and the <i>O Rex, orbis
triumphator</i> and <i>Urbs Aquensis, urbs regalis</i> represent the German
effort to raise Charles the Great to a place among the saints of the
calendar.</p>
<p>Hymns which deal with much greater themes are the metrical
antiphon, <i>Veni, sancte Spiritus, Reple</i>, whose early translations
hold a high place in German hymnology; the <i>Recolamus sacram
coenam</i>, which Mone well characterizes as a side-piece to the great
communion hymn of Thomas Aquinas, <i>Lauda, Sion, Salvatorem</i>.
Like that, it aims at stating the doctrine of Transubstantiation in its
most paradoxical form (<i>stat esus integer</i>). The century furnishes
several pretty Christmas hymns&mdash;<i>En Trinitatis speculum</i>, <i>Dies est
laetitiae</i>, <i>Nunc angelorum gloria</i>, <i>Omnis mundus jucundetur</i>, and
<i>Resonet in laudibus</i>&mdash;all of German origin seemingly and early
known to the German people by translations. This is the festival
which the childlike and child-loving Teutons always have made
the most of; and these hymns, with others of the next century,
are among the earliest monuments of the fact. To this, or possibly
the next century, belongs the mystical prayer-hymn, <i>Anima
Christi, sanctifica me</i>, which came to be ascribed to Ignatius Loyola,
because it was a favorite with him.</p>
<p>The most notable hymn-writer of the century is Conrad, prior
of Gaming, a town in Lower Austria, where he lived during the
reign of Charles IV. (1350-78). We have his manuscript collection
in a copy made in the next century and preserved at M&uuml;nchen.
It contains thirty-seven hymns which probably are his, and many
of them certainly so. Some certainly are recasts of earlier hymns.
Thus he has tinkered Hildebert&rsquo;s great hymn, without at all improving
it. Most of his hymns relate to Mary, the apostles, and
the other saints of the Church. His hymns show a certain facility
in the use of Latin verse, but no force of original inspiration.
They are correct metrically and, from the standpoint of his Church,
theologically. The <i>O colenda Deitas</i> is the most notable.</p>
<p>From the same quarter of Germany and the banks of the same
Ems River, Engelbert, Benedictine abbot of Admont in Styria
(died 1331), offers us a Marian psalter, which has been ascribed
to Thomas Aquinas, but of which two verses content even Mone.
Aegidius, Archbishop of Burgos in Spain, from 1295 to 1315, has
<span class="pb" id="Page_387">387</span>
written a hymn to the alleged portrait of Christ impressed on the
handkerchief of Veronica. It is in the rollicking Goliardic metre,
but the subject is handled with skill and success. It has been
conjectured that he is the author of the <i>Patris sapientia</i> in the
same metre, which some put back to the twelfth century and
others ascribe to Pope Benedict XII., who died in 1342. This is
one of the many hymns to whose recitation an indulgence was
attached.</p>
<p>That the fifteenth century saw the invention of printing is a
cardinal fact for the hymnologist. It was especially in the service
of the Church that the new art found employment, and more missals,
breviaries, and other Church books were printed between its
discovery, in 1452, and the beginning of the Reformation, than of
any other class of books. From this time, therefore, we have to
deal with both written and printed sources, and printing was the
means of saving a multitude of good hymns and sequences which
else might have been lost utterly. The century also witnesses that
great revival of learning to whose advancement printing contributed
greatly, and which in its turn prepared men for the Reformation.
We have seen in the chapter on the two breviaries how it affected
the editing of old hymns and the writing of new. But this does
not begin until the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>As in the case of the preceding century, we are embarrassed by
the abundance of bad, mediocre, and middling good hymns, by
the fewness of those which are really good, and the absence of
such as would be entitled to take the highest rank. The best of
the anonymous which we can trace farther back than to the printed
breviaries are the continuation of the series of German Christmas
hymns, whose beginning we noticed in the fourteenth century.
Such are the <i>In natali Domini</i>, the <i>Nobis est natus hodie</i>, the <i>Quem
pastores laudav&ecirc;re</i>, the <i>Puer nobis nascitur</i>, the <i>Eia mea anima</i>, the
<i>Verbum caro factum est</i>, and the <i>Puer natus in Bethlehem</i>. Of the
last, Dr. A. R. Thompson&rsquo;s translation is as follows:</p>
<h3>PUER NATUS IN BETHLEHEM.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The child in Bethlehem is born,</p>
<p class="t0">Hail, O Jerusalem, the morn!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here lies he in the cattle-stall</p>
<p class="t0">Whose kingdom boundless is withal.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_388">388</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">This Child, their Master from the skies.</p>

<p class="t0">Gold, frankincense, and myrrh they bring.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Who, entering in turn the place,</p>
<p class="t0">The new King greet with lowly grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Seed of the woman lies he there,</p>
<p class="t0">And no man&rsquo;s son, this Child so fair.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Unwounded by the serpent&rsquo;s sting,</p>
<p class="t0">Of our own blood comes in the King.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like us in mortal flesh is he,</p>
<p class="t0">Unlike us in his purity.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That so he might restore us men</p>
<p class="t0">Like to himself and God again.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wherefore, on this his natal day,</p>
<p class="t0">Glad, to our Lord, we homage pay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We praise the Holy Trinity,</p>
<p class="t0">And render thanks, O God, to thee!</p>
</div>
<p>What Ruskin remarks of the disposition of the art of the time
to dwell on the darker side of things&mdash;to insist on the seeming
preponderance of darkness over light, death over life&mdash;is seen also
in its hymns. The Advent hymn, <i>Veni, veni, rex gloriae</i>, is as
gloomy a lucubration as ever was associated with a Church festival.
The <i>Homo tristis esto</i>, which is a study of the Lord&rsquo;s passion apart
from His resurrection, is hardly more gloomy. But other poets
have more joyful strains. In the <i>Haec est dies triumphalis</i> we have
an Easter hymn, and an Ascension hymn in the <i>Coelos ascendit
hodie</i>, which are fittingly joyful; and in the <i>Spiritus sancte gratia</i>
an invocation of the Comforter more prosaic than its great predecessors,
but with its own place in the presentation of that great
theme. A rather fine Trinity hymn is the <i>O Pater, sancte, mitis
atque pie</i>, written in a sort of sapphic verse with iambic feet before
the caesura, and trochaic following it, the feet in each case being
determined by accent, not quantity. Mr. Chambers and Mr.
Hewett both have translated it.</p>
<p>Of the innumerable hymns and sequences to the saints, we
notice that our Lord&rsquo;s grandmother comes in for an increasing
<span class="pb" id="Page_389">389</span>
share. Mone in his third volume gives twenty-five, of which sixteen
belong to this century and eight to the fourteenth. It is significant
that one of them, <i>O stella maris fulgida</i>, is a hymn to
Mary, which was altered to the new devotion to her mother. She
is hailed in others as the &ldquo;refuge of sinners&rdquo; (<i>peccantibus refugium</i>),
and declared immaculate (<i>Anna labe carens</i>), and exalted
in a way which suggests that the other members of the genealogical
line which connects our Lord with Adam have been neglected
most unfairly. Why stop with His grandmother and exclude His
grandfather? It was in the next century that the cult of Joseph
came to the front. Of the Marian hymns of this time the <i>Virginis
in gremio</i> is about the best, and the <i>Ave hierarchia</i> comes next.
The <i>Ave Martha gloriosa</i>, in commemoration of Martha of Bethany,
is a fine hymn in itself, and interesting as one of a group of hymns
composed in Southern France in honor of this particular saint. A
Church myth brings her to Provence to kill the monster (<i>&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;</i>)
from which Tarascon takes its name, and the Church at Arles still
bears a sculptured representation of the victory. Her real function
in Provence was to take the place of the Martis or Brito-Martis, who
was the chief loyal deity, and from whom Marseilles probably took
its name. She was either of Cretan or Phoenician origin, and corresponded
to the Greek Artemis, her name meaning Blessed
Maiden. So her myth was transferred to the over-busy woman of Judea</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Per te serpens est subversus,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>which saved a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>A hymn to the crown of thorns, <i>Sacrae Christi celebremus</i>, is
quite in the manner of Adam of St. Victor; the same marvellous
ingenuity of allusion to remote Scripture facts, and the same
technical mastery of flowing verse. The <i>Novum sidus exoritur</i> is
the oldest Transfiguration hymn&mdash;that being now a Church festival&mdash;and
by no means the worst.</p>
<p>The sequence on the Three Holy Kings (or Magi), who brought
offerings to the infant Saviour, which begins <i>Majestati sacrosanctae</i>,
is referred by some critics to the next century. But as it occurs
in the list of sequences which Joachim Brander, a monk of St.
Gall, drew up in 1507 for Abbot Franz von Gaisberg of that monastery,
it probably belongs to the fifteenth century. Brander
<span class="pb" id="Page_390">390</span>
enumerates three hundred and seventy-eight sequences, specifying
their subjects and authors, the latter not always successfully, and
closes with that which Franz von Gaisberg composed in honor of
Notker Balbulus. His list will be found in Daniel&rsquo;s fifth volume.
Of this, in commemoration of the three kings, whose relics are supposed
to rest in the cathedral at Koeln (Cologne), he says that it
is beautiful and one of the best. Mr. Duffield has left a translation of part:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A threefold gift three kings have brought</p>
<p class="t0">To Christ, God-man, who once was wrought</p>
<p class="t2">In flesh and spirit equally;</p>
<p class="t0">A God triune by gifts adored&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Three gifts which mark one perfect Lord,</p>
<p class="t2">Whose essence is triunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They bring him myrrh, frankincense, gold;</p>
<p class="t0">Outweighing wealth of kings untold&mdash;</p>
<p class="t2">A type in which the truth is known.</p>
<p class="t0">The gifts are three, the emblems three:</p>
<p class="t0">Gold for the king, incense to deity,</p>
<p class="t2">And myrrh, by which his death is shown.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Of hymn-writers, the most prolific is Jean Momboir, generally
known by his Latin name Johannes Mauburnus. He was born in
1460 and died in 1503, and was a Canon Regular in the congregation
founded by the Brethren of the Common Life in the Low
Countries. He lived for a time at Mount St. Agnes, which makes
his emphatic testimony as to the authorship of the <i>De Imitatione</i>
of especial importance. His huge ascetic work, the <i>Spiritual
Rosegarden</i> (<i>Rosetum spirituale</i>) made him famous, and he was
invited to France to reform the Canons Regular, according to the
strict observance used in the Low Countries. He was thus, like
John Staupitz, a representative of the current revival of that age,
which tended to greater austerity, not to faith and joy. He spent
the last six years of his life in this labor, dying at Paris in 1503.
He was the friend and correspondent of Erasmus. His hymns
generally begin with an O, and seem to be written on a system
like that of the scholastic treatises. Indeed, his <i>Rosegarden</i>, both
by its bulk and its method, suggests a <i>Summa</i> of Christian devotion.
From his poem, <i>Eia mea anima</i>, given, there has been extracted
the pretty Christmas hymn, <i>Heu quid jaces stabulo</i>, which
has been translated several times into English and German.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
<p>Next to him comes Casimir, Crown Prince of Poland, whose
<i>Omni die dic Mariae</i> is a Marian hymn in one hundred and
twenty six verses. Father Ragey, however, asserts in <i>Les Annales
de Philosophie Chretienne</i> for May and June, 1883, that Casimir is
not the author but the admirer of these verses, that they are an
extract from a poem in eleven hundred verses, and that Anselm
of Canterbury is the probable author. On this he bases an argument
for the reconciliation of England to the Church, which is devoted
to the cult of our Lord&rsquo;s mother. The poem, whosoever
wrote it, is a fine one&mdash;too good, Protestants will think, for the
theme, and too good to take its place among the other verses ascribed
to Anselm of Canterbury. Here also there is room to ask
a close examination of the manuscripts to which Father Ragey
appeals, with reference to their dates. The controversy over the
antiquity of the <i>Quicunque vult salvus esse</i> and the authorship of the
<i>Imitation</i> suggest caution in taking the <i>ipse dixit</i> of diplomatists.</p>
<p>To an unknown Babo, and to Jacob, schoolmaster of Muldorf,
are attributed Marian hymns of no great value. More important
is Dionysius Ryckel (1394-1471), a Belgian Carthusian, the
character of whose multitudinous writings is indicated by his title,
<i>Doctor Ecstaticus</i>. He wrote a <i>Comment on Certain Ancient Hymns
of the Church</i> (<i>Enarratio in Hymnos aliquot veteres ecclesiasticos</i>),
which puts him next to Radulph de Rivo (<i>ob.</i> 1403) among the
earliest of the hymnologists. To Dionysius is ascribed also the
long poem on the Judgment, from which Mone has given an extract&mdash;<i>Homo,
Dei creatura</i>, etc.&mdash;by way of comparison with the
<i>Dies Irae</i> and the <i>Cum revolvo toto corde</i>. It evidently has been
influenced by the former, but is devoted to a picture of eternal
torment.</p>
<p>To John Huss we owe the beautiful Communion hymn, <i>Jesus
Christus, noster salus</i>, which shows that his alleged heresies did
not touch the Church doctrine on this point.</p>
<p>To Peter of Dresden, schoolmaster of Zwickau in 1420, and
afterward described as a Hussite or a Waldensian, is ascribed the</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In dulci jubilo</p>
<p class="t0">Nu singet und seit fro,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>which is the type of the mixed hymns of this age. It was his purpose
to secure the introduction of hymns in the vernacular into
<span class="pb" id="Page_392">392</span>
the Church services, as his friend Jakob of Misa sought to do in
Bohemia. In mixed hymns of this kind he seems to have tried
to find the sharp end of the wedge. Some ascribe to him the
<i>Puer natus in Bethlehem</i>, which also exists in the mixed form.
Both hymns long stood in the Lutheran hymn-books in the mixed
form,&mdash;for instance, in the <i>Marburg Hymn-Book</i>, which was used
by the Lutherans of Colonial Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The invention of printing from movable types, about 1452, by
Johann Gutenberg of Mainz marks an era in Latin hymnology,
because of the prompt use of the new method to multiply the
Church books in use in the various dioceses. In every part of
Western Europe, from Aberdeen, Lund, and Trondhjem, on the
north, to the shores of the Mediterranean, the missals, breviaries,
and hymnaries were given to the early printers, with the result of
bringing to light many fine hymns and sequences whose use had
been merely local. The Sarum Breviary and Missal and those of
Rome and Paris were printed more frequently than any other.
To the Sarum Breviary we owe the fine Transfiguration hymns&mdash;<i>Coelestis
formam gloriae</i> and <i>O nata lux de lumine</i> and <i>O sator
rerum reparator aevi</i>, which Anglican translators have made into
English hymns; to the Missal the fine sequence on the crown of
thorns, <i>Si vis vere gloriari</i>, of which Dr. Whewell published a
translation in <i>Frazer&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for May, 1849. To the York
Processional (1530) we owe the four &ldquo;proses&rdquo; which begin <i>Salve
festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo</i>, which suggest to Daniel that &ldquo;in
England also there was no lack of those who celebrated the divine
majesty in very sweet hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Breviary and Missal of Trondhjem (Drontheim, anciently
Nidaros) we owe some of the finest hymns and sequences recovered
at this time. Of these the <i>Jubilemus cordis voce</i> is the most characteristic
and perhaps the most beautiful&mdash;full of local color and
characteristic love of nature. Mr. Morgan has translated it; but
the dedication hymn, <i>Sacrae Sion adsunt encaenia</i>, has found more
favor with Anglican translators, and commends itself by scriptural
simplicity. Of course this breviary has fine hymns to St. Olaf,
the king who did so much to make Norway a Christian country,
although hardly so much as his neglected predecessor, Olaf
Tryggveson. Similarly the Swedish missals honor King Eric and
St. Birgitta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_393">393</div>
<p>The German Church books yield less that is novel probably
because the earlier German sources have been so much more thoroughly
explored. The breviaries of Lubec, of Mainz, of Koeln,
and of Meissen furnish most, but chiefly in praises of the Mother
of our Lord and the saints. The <i>Gloriosi Salvatoris nominis praeconia</i>
of Meissen is an exception, and has found many admirers
and several translators. From Mainz comes the fine hymn in
honor of the apostles, <i>Qui sunt isti, qui volant</i>, and that for the
martyrs, <i>O beata beatorum</i>, and the Passion hymn, <i>Laus sit Regi
gloriae, Cujus rore gratiae</i>.</p>
<p>It is different with the French Church books and those of Walloon
Belgium. From the Breton see of Rennes, and those of
Angers, Le Mans, and Poitiers in the adjacent provinces of Northwestern
France come some of the best hymns of this class. From
Rennes comes the pretty and fanciful sequence on the Saviour&rsquo;s
crown of thorns, <i>Florem spina coronavit</i>; from Angers the Christmas
hymn, <i>Sonent Regi nato nova cantica</i>, which shows how far the
French lag behind the Germans of the same age in handling this
theme; also the Advent sequence, <i>Jubilemus omnes una</i>, which
suggests Francis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song of the Creatures,&rdquo; but lacks its tenderness.
From Le Mans the <i>Die parente temporum</i>, which Sir Henry
Baker has made English in &ldquo;On this day, the first of days.&rdquo;
From Poitiers the fine Advent sequence, <i>Prope est claritudinis
magnae dies</i>, translated by Mr. Hewett. From Noyon, in Northeastern
France, the two Christmas hymns, <i>Lux est orta gentibus</i>
and <i>Laetare, puerpera</i>, whose beauty is defaced by making the
Mother and not the divine Child the central figure.</p>
<p>From the Missal of Belgian Tournay we have the Easter
sequence, <i>Surgit Christus cum tropaeo</i>, and the transfiguration
sequence, <i>De Parente summo natum</i>, which have found and deserved
translators. From that of Liege several sequences, of which
the best is that for All Saints Day, <i>Resultet tellus et alta coelorum
machina</i>. In the South it is the breviaries of Braga, in Portugal,
and Piacenza, in Italy, which have furnished most new hymns.</p>
<p>From the breviaries of the great monastic orders come many
hymns, those of the Franciscans furnishing the greater number.
That of the Cistercians furnishes the <i>Domine Jesu, noverim me,
noverim Te</i>, one of the many hymns suggested by passages in the
writings of Augustine of Hippo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_394">394</div>
<p>This notice of the early printed Church books, which Daniel,
Neale, Morell, and Kehrein have brought under requisition, carries
us over into the century of the Reformation, which also is that in
which the Renaissance began to affect the matter and manner of
hymn-writing. Already in the fifteenth century we have hymns
of the humanist type by Aeneas Sylvius (Pope Pius II.); by
Adam Wernher of Themar, a friend of Johann Trithemius, a jurist
by profession, and the instructor of Philip of Hesse in the humanities;
and by Sebastian Brandt, the celebrated author of the
&ldquo;Ship of Fools.&rdquo; All these give careful attention to classic Roman
models in the matter of both prosody and vocabulary. If we
were to put Brandt&rsquo;s <i>Sidus ex claro veniens Olympo</i> alongside the
<i>Puer natus in Bethlehem</i>, we should see how little of the life and
force of simplicity and reality there was in the new poetry.</p>
<p>The sixteenth century begins with the hymns of the humanist Alexander
Hegius, a pupil of the school at Deventer and a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>
of the Brethren of the Common Life, who may have known
Thomas &agrave; Kempis, as he was born in 1433, or at latest in 1445.
He died in 1498, but his hymns appeared in 1501 and 1503. He
was the friend of Rudolph Agricola and of Erasmus, and introduced
the new learning, especially Greek, into Holland. His
hymns are pagan in their vocabulary, although in accord with the
orthodoxy of the time. Two lines of his,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Qui te &lsquo;Matrem&rsquo; vocat, orbis</p>
<p class="t0">Regem vocat ille parentem,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>might have suggested two of Keble&rsquo;s, which have given no small
offence,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Henceforth, whom thousand worlds adore,</p>
<p class="t0">He calls thee &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; evermore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To Zacharias Ferrari ample reference has been made in the
chapter on the Breviaries. Specimens of his work may be found
in Wackernagel&rsquo;s first volume, as also of the hymns of Erasmus
(1467-1536), of Jakob Montanus (1485-1588), of Helius Eobanus
Hessus (1488-1540), and Marc-Antonius Muretus. To these
Roman Catholic humanists&mdash;Eobanus Hessus afterward became a
Lutheran&mdash;might have been added J. Ludovicus Vives (1492-1540),
Marc-Antonio Flaminio (1498-1550), and Matthias Collinus
(<i>ob.</i> 1566). Wackernagel does add Joste Clichtove (<i>ob.</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_395">395</span>
1543), and Jakob Meyer (1491-1552), who did not attempt original
hymns, but recast in classic forms those already in use.
Clichtove was a Fleming, and one of the earliest collectors.</p>
<p>The series of Protestant hymn-writers joins hard on to that of
the Roman Catholic humanists. In the main they belong to the
same school. Their hymns are not, like the Protestant German
hymns, the spontaneous and inevitable outpouring of simple and
natural emotion&mdash;a quality which puts Luther and Johann Herrmann
beside Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas of Celano. They
are the scholastic exercises of men singing the praise of God in a
tongue foreign to their thought. Even the best of them, George
Fabricius of Chemnitz, whose edition of the early Christian poets
has laid us under permanent obligations, although the most careful
to avoid paganisms in his hymns, and the most influenced by
the earlier Latin hymns, never impresses us with the freedom and
spontaneity of his verse. The series runs: Urbanus Rhegius (<i>ob.</i>
1541), Philip Melanchthon (1497-1572), Wolfgang Musculus
(1497-1563), Joachim Camerarius (1500-74), Paul Eber (1511-69),
Bishop John Parkhurst of Norwich (1511-74), Johann Stigel
(1515-71), George Fabricius (1516-71), George Klee, or Thymus
(<i>fl.</i> 1548-50), Nicholas Selneccer (1530-92), Ludwig Helmbold
(1532-98), Wolfgang Ammonius (1579), and Theodore Zwinger
(1533-88). Recasts of old hymns both as to literary form and
theological content we have from Hermann Bonn (1504-48),
Urbanus Rhegius, George Klee, and Andreas Ellinger (1526-82).
The last-named was a German physician who graduated at Wittemberg
in 1549. His <i>Hymnorum Ecclesiasticorum Libri Tres</i> (1578)
is described by Daniel as the most copious collection he has seen,
but worthless as an authority in its first and second books, as the
hymns in these are altered for metrical reasons. Hermann Bonn
was a Westphalian, who became the first Lutheran Superintendent
in Lubeck, and introduced the Reformation into Osnabruck. He
published the first hymn-book in Platt-Deutsch in 1547.</p>
<p>To a later generation belongs Wilhelm Alard (1572-1645), the
son of a Flemish Lutheran, who fled to Germany from the Inquisition.
Wilhelm studied at Wittemberg, and became pastor at
Crempe in Holstein, and published two or perhaps three small
volumes of original Latin hymns. Dr. Trench has extracted from
one of these two hymns. Of that to his Guardian Angel, Chancellor
<span class="pb" id="Page_396">396</span>
Benedict, Dr. Washburn, and Mr. Duffield have made
translations. This is Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s:</p>
<h3>CUM ME TENENT FALLACIA.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When specious joys of earth are mine,</p>
<p class="t">When bright this passing world doth shine,</p>
<p class="t0">Then in his watchful heavenly place</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But when with tears my eyes o&rsquo;errun</p>

<p>Another on the Eucharist Mr. Duffield alone has translated:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I behold thy sacred blood,</p>
<p class="t">Thy body broken for my good;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So may this flame consume away</p>

<p class="t">Break through my darkness utterly,</p>

<p class="t">Thine own dear guidance everywhere.</p>
</div>
<p>A very different group are the hymn-writers of the Jesuit Order,
to whom we owe many hymns which have been ascribed to mediaeval
authors, although they have marked characteristics which
betray their authorship. Thus the <i>Eia Phoebe, nunc serena</i> has
<span class="pb" id="Page_397">397</span>
been ascribed to Innocent III., the <i>O esca viatorum</i> to Thomas
Aquinas, the <i>O gens beata coelitum</i> to Augustine, the <i>Pone luctum,
Magdalena</i> to Adam of St. Victor; while the later Middle Ages
have been credited with the <i>Angelice patrone</i>, the <i>Ecquis binas
columbinas</i>, the <i>Jesu meae deliciae</i>, and the <i>Plaudite coeli</i>. The
London <i>Spectator</i> ascribes a very early origin to the <i>Dormi, fili,
dormi</i>. All these are Jesuit hymns, collected by Walraff (1806)
out of the <i>Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicarum a Patribus Societatis
Jesu</i>. The title of that collection (<i>Psalteriolum</i>) is suggestive of
the contents. As the critics of the Society long ago remarked,
there is a mark of pettiness on the literature, the art, the architecture,
and the theology of the Jesuits. In both prose and poetry
they tend to run into diminutives. No hymn of theirs has handled
any of the greatest themes of Christian praise in a worthy spirit.
The charge made against them by the Dominicans that in their
labors to convert the Chinese and other pagans they concealed the
cross and passion of our Lord, and presented Him as an infant in
His mother&rsquo;s arms, whether literally true or not, is not out of
harmony with their general tone. Christ in the cradle or on the
lap of His mother is the fit theme of their praises. In their hands
religion loses its severity and God His awfulness. To win the
world they stooped to the world&rsquo;s level, and weakened the moral
force of the divine law by cunning explanations, until, through
Arnauld and his fellow-Jansenists, &ldquo;Christianity appeared again
austere and grave; and the world saw again with awe the pale
face of its crucified Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the Jesuit hymns are very good of their kind. The
<i>Dormi, fili, dormi</i> anticipates the theme of Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;The
Virgin Mary to the Child Jesus,&rdquo; and of Dr. George Macdonald&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Babe Jesus Lay on Mary&rsquo;s Lap.&rdquo; It is beautiful in its way, but
betrays its Jesuit origin by its diminutives. The <i>Ecquis binas
columbinas</i> is a very graceful poem, and the best passion hymn of
the school, but is below the subject. The <i>Tandem audite me</i> is a
hymn based on the false interpretation of Solomon&rsquo;s Song, but is
very pretty. The <i>Pone luctum, Magdalena</i> is perhaps the greatest
of all Jesuit hymns, and has found nine Protestant translators to
do it into English. It is rather a fine poem than a fine hymn.
The <i>Parendum est, cedendum est</i> is a death-bed hymn whose length
and ornateness rob it of a sense of reality. Of the <i>Altitudo, quid
<span class="pb" id="Page_398">398</span>
hic jaces</i> and the <i>Plaudite Coeli</i> Mr. Duffield has left versions which
will enable our readers to judge of their worth for themselves:</p>

<p class="t2">In so low a manger?</p>

<p class="t0">For he alone frees us,</p>
<p class="t">He does as he said,</p>
<p class="t0">Our holy Lord Jesus</p>
<p class="t">Alive from the dead.</p>
</div>
<p>The later additions to the stock of Latin hymns are important
only to the student of Roman Catholic liturgies, as connected
with the new devotions sanctioned from time to time by the Congregation
of Sacred Rites. Thus the devotion to the Sacred Heart
led to the writing of the hymn <i>Quicunque certum quaeritis</i>, which
the Roman Breviary has copied from the Franciscan, and whose
translation by Mr. Caswall has found its way even into Protestant
hymn-books. And the crowning sanction of the extravagant reverence
for our Lord&rsquo;s mother, the declaration that she was conceived
without sin, and the institution of the feast of the Immaculate
Conception, caused Archbishop John von Geissel of Koeln to
write, in 1855, a new sequence for the Missal service,
<i>Virgo virginum praeclara</i>.</p>
<p>Last in the series of the Latin hymn-writers stands the present
pope, Leo XIII., who is the third pope in the long series to whom
any hymn can be ascribed with any degree of certainty, the other
two being Damasus and Urban VIII. In his Latin poems, published
in 1881, there are three hymns in honor of two bishops of
Perugia who suffered martyrdom in the early age of the Church.
They are not remarkable for poetical inspiration, although they
show that his Jesuit masters imbued him with the rules of classic
verse and expression. All his poems have been reprinted in this
country (Baltimore, 1886), with an English version by the Jesuits of
Woodstock College.</p>
<p>In any other field of Christian hymnology we should close our
account of the past by the expression of confidence in the fertility
of the future. But as regards Latin hymnology, we feel that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_400">400</span>
period of greatest value has passed by, and the record is sealed.
While it is true that</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Generations yet unborn</p>
<p class="t">Shall bless and magnify the Lord,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>as Rouse sings, we feel that it will not be in the medium of a dead
language, but in the tongues &ldquo;understanded of the people.&rdquo;
The attempt to maintain Latin as the language&mdash;as the exclusive
speech of Christian worship in Western Europe, is one of those
parts of the Roman Catholic system which are already condemned
by results. The comparative barrenness of Latin hymnology for
the past hundred years is evidence enough that this is not the
channel in which Christian inspiration now flows; and the attention
paid even by Roman Catholic poets to hymn-writing in the national
languages is fresh evidence of the readiness of that communion to
adapt itself to new conditions as soon as this is seen to be inevitable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_401">401</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><span class="small">LATIN HYMNOLOGY AND PROTESTANTISM.</span></h2>
<p>It has been asked by both Roman Catholics and Protestants&mdash;and
not unfairly&mdash;whether the interest shown for the last half century
by Protestant writers in the hymns of Latin Christendom, is
a legitimate one. It is said by the former: &ldquo;You are poaching
on our preserves. All this you admire so much is what your
fathers turned their backs upon when they renounced the Roman
obedience. You cannot with any consistency attempt to naturalize
in your churches and their services, hymns which have been
written for a worship which differs in idea and principle, not in
details merely, from your own. At best you can pick out a little
here and a little there, which seems to suit you. But even then
you are in danger of adopting what teaches doctrine which your
Protestant confessions and their expositors denounce as idolatry,
as when the compilers of the hymnal in use by American Presbyterians
adopted Mr. Caswall&rsquo;s English version of</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Quicunque certum quaeritis,</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>ignoring its express reference to the devotion to the Sacred Heart.
This is a gross instance of what you are doing all the time. If it
lead you back to the bosom of the Catholic Church we shall be
glad of it. But it grates on Catholic nerves to see you employing
the phrase which we regard as a serious statement of doctrinal
truth, as though it were a mere purple patch of rhetoric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This leads us to ask what the Reformation was in the idea of
the Reformers themselves. They never took the ground that the
religious life of Protestant nations and churches was out of all relation
to the life of the nations and churches of Western Europe,
as these were before Luther began his work. With all their regard
for the Scriptures, they never assumed that out of these could
be created a Christian Church upon ground previously held by
Antichrist and him alone. Luther declared that the elements of
<span class="pb" id="Page_402">402</span>
the Church for whose upbuilding he was laboring were just those
in which he had been educated. As he expressed it, these were
found in the Catechism taught to every child in Germany, and
which embraced the creed, the commandments, the sacraments,
and the Our Father. What he had learned from study of the
New Testament was to give these elements their due prominence,
and to disengage them from the additions and corruptions by
which they had been obscured. It was not a destructive revolution,
but a change of doctrinal perspective for which he was contending.
He never lost his relish for the good things he had
learned in the Church of his childhood. While he rendered the
service into the German speech of the people, he followed in the
main the old order of the service in his <i>Deutsche Messe</i>. He also
rendered into German sixteen old hymns, twelve from the Latin,
from Ambrose down to Huss, and four from the old German of
the Middle Ages. In his <i>House-Postil</i> he speaks with great enthusiasm
of the hymns and sequences he had learned to sing in
church as a boy; and in his <i>Table Talk</i>, while he censures Ambrose
as a wordy poet, he praises the <i>Patris Sapientia</i>, but above
all the Passion hymn of Pope Gregory the Great, <i>Rex Christe
factor omnium</i>, as the best of hymns, whether Latin or German.</p>
<p>Melanchthon&rsquo;s gentler spirit more than shared in Luther&rsquo;s reverence
for the good in the mediaeval Church. The antithesis to
Melanchthon, the representative of the extreme party among Protestants,
is Matthias Flacius Illyricus, a man of Slavic stock and
uncompromising temper. Yet he also searched the past for witnesses
to the truth which Luther had proclaimed. He appeals to
a hymn in the Breviary of the Premonstratensian Order, as old, he
thinks, as the twelfth century, which testifies against saint worship:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Adjuvent nos eorum merita,</p>
<p class="t0">Quos propria impediunt scelera?</p>
<p class="t0">Excuset eorum intercessio,</p>
<p class="t0">Quos propria accusat actio?</p>
<p class="t0">At tu, qui eis tribuisti</p>
<p class="t0">Coelestis palmam triumphi,</p>
<p class="t0">Nobis veniam non deneges peccati.</p>
</div>
<p>In the same spirit he and his associates edited the first great
Protestant work on Church history&mdash;the <i>Magdeburg Centuries</i>
(1559-74, in thirteen folio volumes). The first Protestants had
<span class="pb" id="Page_403">403</span>
no more idea of surrendering the history of the Church to the champions
of the Roman Catholic Church, than of giving up to them
the New Testament. They held that down through all the ages
ran a double current of pure Christianity and scholastic perversion
of that, and that the Reformation succeeds to the former as the
Tridentine Church to the latter. This especially as regards the
great central point in controversy, the part of grace and of merit
in the justification of the sinner. And they found the proof of
this continuity especially in the devotions of the early Church.
They found themselves in that great prayer of the Franciscan
monk, which the Roman Missal puts into the mouth of her holiest
members as they gather around the bier of the dead:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Quid sum miser tunc dicturus,</p>
<p class="t0">Quem patronum rogaturus,</p>
<p class="t0">Quum vix justus sit securus?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rex tremendae majestatis,</p>
<p class="t0">Qui salvandos salvas gratis,</p>
<p class="t0">Salve me, fons pietatis!</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever in the Middle Ages,&rdquo; says Albrecht Ritschl, &ldquo;devotion,
so far as it has found articulate expression, rises to the level
of the thought that the value of the Christian life, even where it is
fruitful of good works, is grounded not upon these as human
merits, but upon the mercy of God ... then the same line of
thought is entered upon as that in which the religious consciousness
common to Luther and Zwingli was able to break through
the connection which had subsisted between Catholic doctrine and
the Church institutions for the application of salvation....
Whenever even the Church of Rome places herself in the attitude
of prayer, it is inevitable that in the expression of her religious
discernment, in thanksgiving and petition, all the benefits of
salvation should be referred to God or to Christ; the daily need
for new grace, accordingly, is not expressed in the form of a claim
based upon merits, but in the form of reliance upon God.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>

<p>That the Latin hymns of those earlier centuries show a steadily
increasing amount of unscriptural devotion to the mother of our
Lord and to His saints, and of the materializing view of our
Lord&rsquo;s presence with His Church in the Communion, is undeniable.
But even in these matters the hymns of the primitive and mediaeval
Church are a witness that these and the like misbeliefs and mispractices
are a later growth upon primitive faith and usage.</p>
<p>The first generation of Protestants, to which Luther, Melanchthon,
and Zwingli belong, had been brought up on the hymns of
the Breviary and of the Missal, and they did not abandon their
love for these when they ceased to regard the Latin tongue as the
only fit speech for public worship. They showed their relish for
the old hymns, by publishing collections of them, by translating
them into the national languages, by writing Latin hymns
in imitation of them, and even by continuing their use in public
worship to a limited extent.</p>
<p>As collectors and editors of the old Latin hymns, the Protestants
of the sixteenth century surpassed the Roman Catholics of that
age. Over against the names of Hermann Torrentinus (1513 and
1536), Jacob Wimpheling (1519), Joste Clichtove (1515-19),
Jacob van Meyer (1535), Lorenzo Massorillo (1547), and George
Cassander (1556), the Roman Catholic hymnologists of the half
century which followed the Reformation, we may place the anonymous
collector of Basel (1538), Johann Spangenberg (1545),
Lucas Lossius (1552 <i>et seq.</i>, with Preface by Melanchthon), Paul
Eber (1564), George Fabricius (1564), Christopher Corner (1568),
Hermann Bonn (1569), George Major (1570), Andreas Ellinger
(1573), Adam Siber (1577), Matthew Luidke (1589), and Francis
Algerman (1596). All these, with the possible exception of the
first, were Lutherans, trained in the humanistic school of Latin
criticism and poetry; but only two of them found it needful or
desirable to alter the hymns into conformity with the tastes of the
age. The collections of Hermann Bonn, the first Lutheran superintendent
of Lubeck, and that of George Fabricius, are especially
important, as faithfully reproducing much that else might have
been lost to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_405">405</div>
<p>The work of translating the old Latin hymns fell especially to
the Lutherans. Roman Catholic preference was no stronger for
the original Latin than that of the Reformed for the Psalms. Of
the great German hymn-writers from Luther to Paul Gerhardt,
nearly all made translations from the storehouse of Latin hymnody,
Bernard of Clairvaux being the especial favorite with Johann Heermann,
John Arndt, and Paul Gerhardt. And even in hymns
which are not translations, the influence of the Latin hymns is
seen in the epic tone, the healthy objectivity of the German hymns
of this age, in contrast to the frequently morbid subjectivity of
those which belong to the age of Pietism.</p>
<p>More interesting to us are the early translations into English.
The first are to be found in the <i>Primer</i> of 1545, a book of private
devotions after the model of the Breviary, published in Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s time both in English in 1545 and again in Latin (<i>Orarium</i>)
in 1546. In the next reign a substitute for this in English alone
was prepared by the more Protestant authorities of the Anglican
Church, in which, besides sundry doctrinal changes, the hymns
were omitted. But the scale inclined somewhat the other way
after Elizabeth&rsquo;s accession. The English <i>Primer</i> of 1559 and the
Latin <i>Orarium</i> of 1560 are revised editions of her father&rsquo;s, not of
her brother&rsquo;s publications. The parts devoted to the worship of
Mary are omitted, but the prayers for the dead and the hymns are
retained. These old versions are clumsy enough, but not without
interest as the first of their kind. Here is one with the original
text from the <i>Orarium</i>, differing from any other authority known
to us:</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>It is not wonderful that when the Anglo-Catholics sought to revive
the <i>Primer</i> as &ldquo;the authorized book of Family and Private
Prayer&rdquo; on the same footing as the Prayer book, they took the
liberty of substituting modern versions of the hymns for these &ldquo;authorized&rdquo;
translations.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
But the <i>Primer</i>, whatever its authority,
never possessed that much more important requisite to success&mdash;vitality.
A very few editions sufficed for the demand, and
Bishop Cosin&rsquo;s attempt to revive it in Charles I.&rsquo;s time only
provoked a Puritan outcry against both him and it. Rev. Gerard
Moultrie has attempted to revive it in our own time, as &ldquo;the only
book of private devotion which has received the sanction of the
English Church,&rdquo; and has not achieved even thus much of success.
No Prynne has assailed him.</p>
<p>In the Book of Common Prayer, besides such &ldquo;canticles&rdquo; as
the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> and the <i>Te Deum</i>, there is but one hymn,
an English version of the <i>Veni, Creator Spiritus</i> in the Ordination
Service. It is the wordiest of all known versions, rendering one
hundred and five Latin by three hundred and fifty-seven English
words, but is not without its old-fashioned felicities. The revisers
of 1661 cut it down by omitting just half of it, and modernized the
English in a number of places. Its very verbosity seems to have
suggested Bishop Cosin&rsquo;s terse version, containing but four more
<span class="pb" id="Page_407">407</span>
words than the original, which, however, it somewhat abridges.
This was inserted in 1661 as an alternate version. The author of
the paraphrase in the Prayer-Book is unknown. It is not Bishop
Coverdale, as his, although translated at second-hand from Luther,
as, indeed, all his hymns are from some German source, is far
closer and less wordy.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>
It also was adopted into the old Scottish
Psalter of the Reformation, where it appears in the appendix,
along with a metrical version of the Apostle&rsquo;s Creed and other
&ldquo;uninspired compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Reformation until about fifty years ago, there was
among English-speaking people no interest in Latin hymnology
worth speaking of. A few Catholic poets, like Crashaw and
Dryden, honored their Church versions from the hymns of the
Breviary. But even John Austin, a Catholic convert of 1640,
when he prepared his <i>Devotions in the Ancient Way of Offices</i>
after the model of the Breviary, wrote for it hymns of his own instead
of translating from the Latin. Some of these (&ldquo;Blessed be
Thy love, dear Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hark, my soul, how everything&rdquo;)
have become a part of our general wealth. Of course some versions
of a homely sort had to be made for Catholic books of devotion,
and I possess <i>The Evening Office of the Church in Latin and
English</i> (London, 1725), in which the Vesper hymns of the
Roman Breviary are closely and roughly versified. It is notable
that &ldquo;the old hymns as they are generally sung in churches&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the hymns as they stood before the revision of 1631, are
printed as an appendix to the book, showing how slow English
Catholics were to accept the modernization of the hymns which
the papacy had sanctioned nearly a century before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_408">408</div>
<p>Mr. Orby Shipley, in his <i>Annus Sanctus</i> (London, 1884), gives a
large number of these early versions from the Roman Catholic
<i>Primers</i> of 1619, 1684, 1685, and 1706; from the <i>Evening Office</i> of
1710, 1725, and 1785; and from the <i>Divine Office</i> of 1763 and
1780. The translations of 1619 have been ascribed to William
Drummond, of Hawthornden, and those of 1706 to Dryden.
Drummond was the first Scotchman who adopted English as the
language of literature, and although a Protestant, he belonged to
the Catholicizing party represented by William Forbes, the first
Protestant bishop of Edinburgh. Three hymns are given in Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s edition of Dryden on the authority of English Roman
Catholic tradition, the best known being his version of the
<i>Veni Creator Spiritus</i>. These three are found in the <i>Primer</i> of
1706, along with versions of the other hymns of the Roman Breviary
sufficiently like them to suggest that they are all by the same
hand. But this judgment is disputed.</p>
<p>Among Protestants the neglect was as great. So profuse a
writer of hymns for the Christian year as George Wither translated
only the <i>Te Deum</i> and the <i>Veni, Creator Spiritus</i> into English
verse.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>
Tate and Brady, in their <i>Supplement</i> (1703) to their <i>New
Version of the Psalms</i> (1696), published a translation of the <i>Veni,
Creator Spiritus</i>. But Bishop Symon Patrick was the only hymn-writer
of that age who may be said to have given any special attention
to Latin hymns. His hymns were chiefly translations from
that source, especially Prudentius, and Lord Selborne mentions
that of <i>Alleluia, dulce carmen</i>, as the best.</p>
<p>The Methodist revival, which did so much to enrich our store
of hymns, and which called attention anew to those of Germany,
accomplished nothing for us as regards Latin hymns. The Earl
of Roscommon&rsquo;s translation of the <i>Dies Irae</i> (1717), and Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s affecting reference to the stanza,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Quaerens me sedisti lassus, ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>stand almost alone in that age. It was not until the Romantic
movement in Germany and then in England broke the bonds of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_409">409</span>
merely classic culture, taught the world the beauty of Gothic art,
and obliged men to revise their estimate of the Middle Ages, that
the singers of the praises which sounded through those earlier
centuries had a fair chance to be judged at their real worth. The
forerunner of that movement was Johann Gottfried von Herder,
who indeed may be said to have anticipated the whole intellectual
movement of the past century, Darwinism not excepted. From
his friend and master Hamann, &ldquo;the Magus of the North,&rdquo; he
had learned &ldquo;the necessity for a complete and harmonious expression
of all the varied faculties of man,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;whatever is isolated
or the product of a single faculty is to be condemned.&rdquo;
This made him as much discontented with the eighteenth century
and its literature and philosophy of the enlightened understanding,
as Hamann himself was. It was the foundation for that
Catholic taste which enabled him to appreciate the excellence of
all those popular literatures which are the outflow of the life of
whole peoples. His <i>Voices of the Peoples</i> did for the Continent
what Bishop Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i> did for England, and did it much
better. He saw that &ldquo;the people and a common sentiment are
the foundations of a true poetry,&rdquo; and the literature of the schools
and that of polite society are equally condemned to sterility. For
this reason he had small respect for that classic Latin literature at
whose bar every modern production was impleaded. He found
far more genuine life and power in the Latin poems of the Jesuit
father, Jacob Balde, and still more in the hymns of the Latin
Church. His <i>Letters for the Promotion of Humanity</i> (1794-96)
contain a passage of classic importance:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The hymns which Christianity introduced had for their basis those
old Hebrew Psalms which very soon found their way into the Church, if
not as songs or anthems, at any rate as prayers.... The songs of Mary
and of Zacharias, the Angelic Salutation, the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i> of Simeon,
which open the New Testament, gave character more immediately to the
Christian hymns. Their gentler voice was more suitable to the spirit of
Christianity than even the loud trumpet note of that old jubilant Hallelujah,
although that note was found capable of many applications, and
was now strengthened with the words of prophet or psalmist, now adapted
to gentler strains. Over the graves of the dead, whose resurrection was
already present to the spirit&rsquo;s vision, in caves and catacombs, first were
heard these psalms of repentance and prayer, of sorrow and hope, until
after the public establishment of Christianity, they stepped out of the
dark into the light, out of solitude into splendid churches, before consecrated
<span class="pb" id="Page_410">410</span>
altars, and now assumed a like splendor in their expression.
There is hardly any one who can listen to the <i>Jam moesta quiesce querula</i> of
Prudentius without feeling his heart touched by its moving strains, or
who can hear the funeral sequence <i>Dies irae, dies illa</i>, without a shudder,
or whom so many other hymns, each with its own character&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Veni,
Redemptor gentium</i>; <i>Vexilla Regis prodeunt</i>; <i>Salvete flores Martyrum</i>;
<i>Pange, lingua, gloriosi</i>, etc., will fail to be carried into that frame of feeling
which each seeks to awaken, and with all its humility of form and its
churchly peculiarities, never fails to command. In one there sounds the
voice of prayer; another could find its accompaniment only in the harp;
in yet another the trumpet rings, or there sounds the thousand-voiced
organ, and so on.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;If we seek after the reason of this remarkable effect, which we feel
in hearing these old Christian hymns, we find it somewhat peculiar. It
is anything but the novelty of the <i>thoughts</i> which here touches and there
shakes us. Thoughts in these hymns are found but sparingly. Many are
merely solemn recitations of a well-known story, or they are familiar petitions
and prayers. They nearly all repeat each other. Nor is it frequently
surprisingly fine and novel sentiments with which they somehow
permeate us; the novel and the fine are not objects in the hymns. What,
then, is it that touches us? <i>Simplicity</i> and <i>Veracity</i>. Here sounds the
speech of a general confession of one heart and one faith. Most of them
are constructed either so as to be fit for use every day of the year, or so
as to be used on the festivals of the various seasons. As these come
round there comes with them in constant recurrence their rehearsal of
Christian doctrines. There is nothing superfine in the hymns as regards
either emotion, or duty, or consolation. There reigns in all of them a
general popularity of content, expressed in great accents. He who seeks
novel thoughts in a <i>Te Deum</i> or a <i>Salve Regina</i> looks for them in the
wrong place. It is just what is every day and always known, which here
is to serve as the garb of truth. The hymn is meant to be an ambrosial
offering of nature, deathless like that, and ever returning.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It follows that, as people in these Christian hymns did not look for
the grace of classic expression or the pleasurable emotion of the instant&mdash;in
a word, what we expect from a work of art, they produced the strangest
effects at once after their introduction. Just as Christian hands overthrew
the statues and temples of the gods in honor of the unseen God,
so these hymns contained a germ which was to bring about the death of
the pagan poetry. Not only were those hymns to gods and goddesses,
heroes and geniuses, regarded by the Christians as the work of unbelievers
or misbelievers, but the germ from which they sprang, the poetic
and sportive fancy, the pleasure and rejoicing of the peoples in their
national festivals, were condemned as a school of evil demons; yes, even
the national pride, to which those songs appealed, was despised as a
perilous though splendid sin. The old religion had outlived its time, the
new had won its victory, when the absurdity of idol-worship and pagan
<span class="pb" id="Page_411">411</span>
superstitions, the disorders and abominations which attended the festivals
of Bacchus, Cybele, and Aphrodite, were brought to the light of day.
Whatever of poetry was associated with these was a work of the devil.
There began a new age for poetry, music, speech, the sciences, and indeed
for the whole direction of human thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Romanticist movement gained ground in Germany,
attention to the early hymns increased. Even Goethe, the <i>weltkind</i>
among the prophets, was influenced. Hence his use of the
<i>Dies Irae</i> in the first part of <i>Faust</i>, although he was pagan
enough to care for nothing at Assisi except the Roman remains.
A. W. Schlegel made a number of translations for the <i>Musen-Almanach</i>.
Then came the long series of German translators, of
whom A. J. Rambach, A. L. Follen (brother of Professor Charles
Follen of Harvard), Karl Simrock (1850 and 1866), and G. A.
Koenigsfeld (1847 and 1865) are the most notable. Much more
important to us are the German collectors: G. A. Bj&ouml;rn (a Dane,
1818), J. C. von Zabuesnig (1822 and 1830), H. A. Daniel
(<i>Bl&uuml;thenstrauss</i>, 1840; <i>Thesaurus</i>, 1841-56), F. J. Mone (1853-55),
C. B. Moll (1861 and 1868), P. Gall Morel (1866),
Joseph Kehrein (1873). To the unwearied thoroughness of these
editors, more than of any other laborers in this field, we owe our
ampler access to the treasures of Latin hymnody. But what field
of research is there in which the scholarship of Germany has not
laid the rest of the world under obligations?</p>
<p>In English literature the Romanticist movement begins properly
with Sir Walter Scott. Himself a Presbyterian, he was brought
up on the old Scotch Psalm-book, for which he entertained the
same affection as did Burns, Edward Irving, Campbell, Carlyle,
and Archdeacon Hare. He opposed any attempt to improve it,
on the ground that it was, &ldquo;with all its acknowledged occasional
harshness, so beautiful that any alterations must eventually prove
only so many blemishes.&rdquo; But his literary tastes led him to a
lofty appreciation of the Anglican liturgy&mdash;a circumstance which
has led many to class him as an Episcopalian&mdash;and equally for
the poetry of the mediaeval hymns. His vigorous version of a
part of the <i>Dies Irae</i> inserted in <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> (1805)
gives him his smallest claim to mention in the history of hymnody.
It was the new atmosphere he carried into the educated world, his
fresh and hearty admiration of admirable things in the Middle
<span class="pb" id="Page_412">412</span>
Ages, which had been thought barbarous, that makes him important
to us. He gave the English and Scottish people new weights
and measures, new standards of critical judgment, which emancipated
them from narrow, pseudo-Protestant traditions. He made
the great Church of undivided Western Europe intelligible. No
doubt many follies resulted from this novel lesson, the worst of all
being contempt for Luther and his associates in the Reformation.
The negations which attend such revolutions in opinion always
are foolish exaggerations. It is the affirmations which are valuable
and which remain. And Romanticism for more than half a
century has been affecting the religious, the social, the intellectual
life of Great Britain and America in a thousand ways, and with,
on the whole, positive and beneficial results. Its most powerful
manifestation was in the Oxford movement,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>
but both in its causes and its effects it has transcended the limits which
separate the divided forces of Protestantism.</p>
<p>Naturally the Oxford movement was the first to turn attention
to the hymns of the Middle Ages, or what it regarded as such.
We use this qualified expression because its leaders at the outset
were much better poets than hymnological scholars, and welcomed
anything in the shape of a Latin hymn as &ldquo;primitive,&rdquo; no
matter what. Isaac Williams, in the <i>British Magazine</i> in 1830,
published a series of translations of &ldquo;primitive hymns&rdquo; which he
gathered into a volume in 1839. They were from the Paris
Breviary, of whose hymns only one in fourteen were older than
1685, and most of them not yet a hundred years old. Rev. John
Chandler, in his <i>Hymns of the Primitive Church</i> (1837), drew on
Santeul and Coffin with equal freedom, evidently supposing he
was going back to the early ages for his originals. Bishop Mant,
in his <i>Ancient Hymns from the Roman Breviary</i> (1837), did a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_413">413</span>
better, although not half-a-dozen hymns in that Breviary are unaltered
from their primitive forms, and many are no older than the
fifteenth or sixteenth century. Rev. Edward Caswall, an Oxford
convert to the Church of Rome, naturally confined his <i>Lyra
Catholica</i> (1849) to the Breviary hymns, supplementing those of
Rome with some from Paris. The first collection published by
Dr. Newman (<i>Hymni Ecclesiae</i>, Pars I., 1839) was confined to the
Paris Breviary, but with the notice that they &ldquo;had no equal claim
to antiquity&rdquo; with &ldquo;the discarded collections of the ante-reform
era.&rdquo; But he claimed on rather slight ground that they &ldquo;breathe
an ancient spirit, and even where they are the work of one pen,
are the joint and indivisible contribution of many ancient minds.&rdquo;
This is an opinion of the work of Santeul and Coffin in which
neither Cardinal Newman nor the Gallican Church would agree
to-day.</p>
<p>In fact, these English scholars, with their constant habit of making
Latin verse after classic models from their school-days, and
their entire want of familiarity with post-classic Latin, found what
pleased them best in the two Breviaries of Rome and Paris. With
that they seemed likely to stop. It was Dr. John Mason Neale
(1851-58) who, among translators, first broke these bounds, went
to the older sources, and introduced to English readers, both by
his collections and his translations, the great hymns of the Western
Church. As a translator he leaves much to be desired. His ideas
as to faithful reproduction of the form of his originals are vague.
His hymns too often might be said to be based on the Latin text
rather than to reproduce it. But they are spirited poems, whose
own vigor and beauty sent readers to the original, and they were
not disappointed.</p>
<p>From that time we have had a series of excellent workers in this
field&mdash;John Keble, Rev. W. J. Blew (1855), Mr. J. D. Chambers
(1857 and 1866), Rev. J. W. Hewett (1859), Sir Henry Baker
(1861 and 1868), Rev. Herbert Kynaston (1862), Rev. J. Trend
(1862), Rev. P. S. Worsley (1863), Earl Nelson (1857 and 1868),
Rev. Richard F. Littledale (1867), R. Campbell, of the Anglo-Catholic
<span class="pb" id="Page_414">414</span>
party; and Dean Stanley, Mrs. Charles (1858 and 1866)
and Dr. Hamilton Magill (1876) outside its ranks. Theirs have
been no inconsiderable part of those labors which have made the
last thirty years the golden age of English hymn-writing, surpassing
even the era of the Methodist revival.</p>
<p>In America the work was begun in 1840 with a modest little
volume published at Auburn, in New York, and ascribed by Mr.
Duffield to Dr. Henry Mills of Auburn Theological Seminary,
who in 1856 also published a volume of translations of German
hymns. His earlier book was <i>The Hymn of Hildebert and the Ode
of Xavier, with English Versions</i>, and contained thirty-five duodecimo
pages. Next in order came Dr. John Williams, Bishop
of Connecticut, with <i>Ancient Hymns of the Holy Church</i> (1845).
Dr. William R. Williams of New York, in his address on &ldquo;The
Conservative Principle in our Literature,&rdquo; delivered in 1843,
made a reference to the <i>Dies Irae</i>, which gave him the occasion to
publish in an Appendix the literary history of the great hymn,
giving the text along with Dr. Trench&rsquo;s version and his own.
This seems to have given the impulse which has made America so
prolific in translations of that hymn, only Germany surpassing us
in this respect. Dr. Abraham Coles may be said to have led off
with his volume, containing thirteen translations in 1847. But it
was not until after the war for the Union that the productive
powers of American translators were brought into play. Much,
no doubt, was due to foreign impulse, especially from Dr. Trench
and Dr. Newman; but it is notable that in America far more work
has been done outside than inside the Episcopalian communion.</p>
<p>Dr. Coles again in 1866, Mr. Duffield in 1867, Chancellor
Benedict in 1869, Hon. N. B. Smithers in 1879 and 1881, and
Mr. John L. Hayes in 1887 published volumes of translations.
But far more numerous are the poets whose versions of Latin
hymns have appeared in various periodicals or in collections like
Professor Copp&eacute;e&rsquo;s <i>Songs of Praise</i> (1866), Dr. Schaff&rsquo;s <i>Christ in
Song</i> (1869), Odenheimer and Bird&rsquo;s <i>Songs of the Spirit</i> (1871),
Dr. H. C. Fish&rsquo;s <i>Heaven in Song</i> (1874), Frank Foxcroft&rsquo;s <i>Resurgit</i>
(1879), and Dr. Schaff and Arthur Gilman&rsquo;s <i>Library of Sacred
Poetry</i> (1881 and 1886). Of these contributing poets we mention
Dr. E. A. Washburn, whose translations have been collected in
his posthumous volume, <i>Voices from a Busy Life</i> (1883); Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_415">415</span>
Ray Palmer, our chief sacred singer, whose versions of the <i>O esca
viatorum</i> and the <i>Jesu dulcis memoria</i> are as classic as his &ldquo;My
faith looks up to Thee;&rdquo; Dr. A. R. Thompson, to whom the
present volume is under great obligations; Rev. J. Anketell, another
of its benefactors; Rev. M. Woolsey Stryker, Rev. D. Y.
Heisler, Rev. Franklin Johnson, D.D., and Rev. W. S. McKenzie,
D.D. Besides these we may mention the anthology of translations
published by the Rev. F. Wilson (1859), of texts by Professor
F. A. March (1874 and 1883), and of both texts and translations
by Judge C. C. Nott (1865 and subsequent years).</p>
<p>It is not, however, only as literature, but in the actual use of the
American churches, that the Latin hymns have made a place for
themselves. Since 1859, when the Andover professors published
the <i>Sabbath Hymn and Tune-Book</i>, with original translations furnished
by Dr. Ray Palmer, there has been a peaceful revolution
in American hymnology. Every one of the larger denominations
and many of the smaller have provided themselves with new hymn-books,
in which the resources of English, foreign, and ancient
hymnology have been employed freely, and with more exacting
taste as to sense and form, than characterized the hymn-books of
the era before the war. While the compilers have drawn freely
upon Caswall, Neale, Chandler, and the Anglican <i>Hymns Ancient
and Modern</i> (1861), in many cases original translations were given,
as in <i>Hymns of the Church</i> for the (Dutch) Reformed Church, of
which Dr. A. R. Thompson was one of the editors; and Dr.
Charles Robinson&rsquo;s <i>Laudes Domini</i> (1884), to which Mr. Duffield
contributed. And there is evidence that the hymns thus brought
into Church use from the storehouse of the earlier Christian ages
have helped thoughtful Christians to realize more fully the great
principle of the Communion of the saints&mdash;to realize that all the
faithful of the present are bound in spiritual brotherhood with
those who held to the same Head and walked in the light of the
same faith in bygone centuries, even though it was with stumbling
and amid shadows, from which our path by God&rsquo;s good providence
has been set free.</p>

<br /><span class="small">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES.</span></h2>
<p>The first sources of the Latin hymns and sequences are the
manuscript and printed breviaries and missals of the Western
Church. Both these have been explored by the collectors from
Clichtove to Kehrein, although it cannot be said that the examination
has been exhaustive either as regards the manuscripts or
the printed books.</p>
<p>The following is an approximate list of the printed breviaries
which have been examined by modern collectors:</p>

<p>Of lesser church-books Zabuesnig has used the <i>Processionale</i> of
the Dominicans or Preachers, and Newman that of the Church of
York. Morel has drawn upon the Paris <i>Horae</i> of 1519, and
Daniel on the <i>Cantionale</i> of Konstanz of 1607.</p>
<p>Yet this shows that either only a minority of the printed church-books
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries have been examined,
or else that the majority yielded nothing new in return for such
examination.</p>

<p>We proceed with the bibliography of the collections and the
historical treatises and discussions which bear on Latin Hymnology,
together with the most important volumes of translations.
These we shall give in chronological order, and where the initials
S. W. D. are appended to the comments, it will be understood that
these are by Mr. Duffield, not by his editor. The numbers
marked with an asterisk (*) indicate works employed in the preparation
of the present volume.</p>

<dd>Daniel says that a second edition (1550, 1536?) has so closely
followed Clichtoveus that the first edition only is worthy of note.</dd>
<dd>Hermann Torrentinus was a native of Zwolle, and belonged
to the Brotherhood of the Common Life. He was professor
at Groningen about 1490, and lived until about 1520. He was
one of the group which gathered around John Wessel Gansfort, in
whom Luther recognized a kindred spirit.</dd>

<dd>The best book of its time on the subject, and long indispensable
to the hymnologist. Josse Clichtove was a Flemish theologian.
He studied at Paris under the famous Lefevre d&rsquo;Etaples, and enjoyed
the friendship of Erasmus. He was a zealous opponent of
Luther. He died in 1543. The Venice edition of his <i>Elucidatorium&mdash;Hymni
et Prosae, quae per totum Annum in Ecclesi&acirc; leguntur</i>&mdash;is
much altered, and contains additional hymns from Italian,
French, and Hungarian Breviaries, while it also omits others given

<dd>Daniel calls this the most ample of all the collections, but he
criticises the first two volumes severely for their arrangement, and
the changes in text made for metrical reasons. The third volume
he was able to use, but he felt unsafe in the others except when
the editor positively stated in his notes what he considered the
original and genuine text. S. W. D.</dd>

<dd>Professor Daniel&rsquo;s first appearance in a field in which he still is
the highest authority. Besides his Thesaurus and this little precursor
to it, and the dissertation mentioned below, he labored in
German hymnology, editing an <i>Evangelisches Kirchen-Gesangbuch</i>
in 1842, and Zinzendorf&rsquo;s hymns in 1851. He also took
part in the preparation of the standard German hymn-book of the
Eisenach Conference, which is intended to put an end to the unlimited
variety of hymn-books in the local churches of Germany.
For Ersch and Gruber&rsquo;s huge <i>Encyclop&auml;die</i>, he wrote the article
&ldquo;Gesangbuch,&rdquo; which is reprinted in his <i>Zerstreute Bl&auml;tter</i>
(Halle, 1840). And besides all this he published in 1847-53 a

<dd>In the two last volumes Daniel uses freely and with acknowledgment
the labors especially of Mone and Neale. The fifth volume
contains also indices to all five volumes by first lines, and also a
topical index. The worst defect of the book is the poorness of
this latter. Next to that is its author&rsquo;s very insufficient preparation
for his work when he published his two first volumes; but
that probably was unavoidable. Vols. IV. and V. show how
much he had grown in his mastery of his field of labor. But his
learning and his care give his book a place inferior to none.</dd>

Second edition, 1864; third edition, 1878.</dt>
<dd>Archbishop Trench&rsquo;s little book has had a wide popularity, and
many persons have been induced by it to take a deeper interest in
the subject. But it is disfigured by its arrangement, which excludes
everything that cannot be safely employed by Protestants.
Lines are omitted from Hildebert; the <i>Stabat Mater</i> of Jacoponus
is absent, and the <i>Pange lingua</i> of Aquinas is also missing.
Moreover the notes, which have been easily prepared from Latin
sources, are scarcely satisfactory. Yet, take it for all in all, it is a
volume that may be highly commended, for the archbishop is a
poet, and has a poet&rsquo;s appreciation of the beautiful. We are indebted
to him for hymns from Marbod, Mauburn, W. Alard,
Balde, Pistor, and Alan of Lisle, which are not readily found.

<dd>Mone&rsquo;s book appeared while Daniel&rsquo;s Thesaurus was in process
of publication. The value of it is in its arrangement, for it groups
the hymns, &ldquo;To God and the Angels,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Mary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;To
the Saints,&rdquo; in three separate volumes, and with some regard to
dates. It also furnishes many hymns and sequences never previously
published. It is deficient in taste, and very Roman Catholic
in its ideas. Several of the best known hymns&mdash;for example, the
<i>Dies Irae</i>&mdash;are not found in it. Daniel 5:5 gives in a footnote
a list of these delinquencies, embracing sixty of the most
ancient and celebrated hymns and sequences. Aside from this,
Mone is a careful and admirable editor. His pages are well
printed, and the notes are in German instead of Latin. Mone was
&ldquo;Director of Archives&rdquo; at Carlsruhe, and died March 12th, 1871.

there is scarcely to be found in it a single spark of the divine fire.
It is filled, on the contrary, with the scoriae and ashes of monastic
illiteracy. It contains eight hundred and ninety-five hymns&mdash;few
of which are familiar and many of which are strictly unnecessary.
The classification and especially the glossary of mediaeval Latin
words can be highly commended. It is confined to &ldquo;sequences,&rdquo;

<dd>This little volume of 194 pages, 12mo, is intended to be the first
of a series furnishing translations (with the Latin texts <i>en regard</i>)
of the hymns of the Early Church. In the preface Dr. Linke announces
his purpose to bring out a new <i>Thesaurus Hymnorum</i>,
based on the labors of Daniel, Neale, Mone, and Morel, and on
an examination of about a hundred unused manuscripts. He regards
Wackernagel as the best editor of the texts, and as characterized
by the finest critical instinct in determining authorship.
As he and Wackernagel agree in assigning the <i>Ad coeli clara</i> to
Hilary, there is room for a difference of opinion.</dd>

<h2 id="c35">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><span class="small">INDEX TO TRANSLATED HYMNS.</span></h2>
<p>Among the labors of preparation which Mr. Duffield undertook
as preliminary to this book, the most unique was his manuscript
&ldquo;List of the Latin Hymns,&rdquo; as found in all the collections accessible
to him, from Clichtove to Kehrein, with references to the
authorship, the age, and the sources of each; together with notes
of the names of English translators. It was his intention that the
list should form an integral part of his book; but as it contains
between four and five thousand references by first lines, it would
make a book of itself, and it is the hope of the editor to secure
its separate publication in that form. The work cost so much
patient labor, and is in itself so valuable to hymnological students,
that it would be a pity if it were not made still more complete,
and given to the public at an early date.</p>
<p>It seemed best not to include the list in all its bulk in this
work, but to make from it a selection of those hymns which have
found favor in the eyes of English translators, and to print them
with the names of the translators. These are not one in five of
the whole number of Latin hymns, but they constitute the best of
them, and they are those which are most likely to be of use and
interest to our readers. These eight hundred and seventy hymns,
recasts of hymns, and portions of hymns which translators have
treated as wholes, are a body of sacred song which will bear comparison
with any other in the world, either as regards loftiness of
devotion, weight of thought, or excellence as poetry. And in no
respect has our English hymnody been more enriched during the
last fifty years than by the felicitous versions made by British and
American translators, from Chandler&rsquo;s to our own days.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the name of the author, or the source,
or at least the date of each hymn, is given on the left side of the
list. This is followed by the first line of the hymn, and where
several hymns begin nearly alike, enough is given to identify each.
<span class="pb" id="Page_447">447</span>
After this comes the reference to the source where the hymn is to
be found, if this be known to the editor. Where it is given in
any volume of Daniel&rsquo;s great work, that is referred to by Roman
and Arabic numerals simply, without repetition of his name. In
every case where it is to be found in Newman&rsquo;s <i>Hymni Ecclesiae</i>,
or Trench&rsquo;s <i>Sacred Latin Poetry</i>, or March&rsquo;s <i>Latin Hymns</i>, this is
indicated, as these are the collections most accessible to American
students generally. Then follow in <i>Italics</i> the names of the
translator or translators, either on the same line, or on the lines
below. The use of an asterisk (*) indicates that this is a recast
of an older hymn.</p>
<p>The chapter of &ldquo;Bibliographical Notes&rdquo; will furnish the proper
reference to the sources of the translations in most cases. It is
necessary to specify a few which are not given there.</p>
<p>Rev. John Anketell&rsquo;s translations are given mostly in <i>The Church
Review</i> for 1876 and 1877. For those of Dr. Benson, H. R. B.,
C. I. Black, E. L. Blenkinsopp, W. C. C., J. M. H., Dr. Littledale,
M., A. M. M., O. C. P., J. G. Smith, H. Thompson, J. S.
Tute, R. E. E. W., see Mr. Orby Shipley&rsquo;s three <i>Lyras</i>. For
translations by Prior Aylward, Mr. J. R. Beste, Lord Braye, John
Dryden (?), and other versions from the old Catholic <i>Primers</i> and
<i>Evening Offices</i>, J. C. Earle, Provost Husenbeth, Charles Kent,
Cardinal Newman, Professor Potter, Father Ryder, A. D. Wackerbarth,
and Dr. Wallace, see Mr. Shipley&rsquo;s <i>Annus Sanctus</i>. For
translations by Dr. Littledale, B., F., D. L., A. L. P., F. R., and
B. T., see <i>The People&rsquo;s Hymnal</i> (1877); for those of Mr. Singleton,
see <i>The Anglican Hymn-Book</i> (1868); for those of Mr. Blew,
see his <i>Church Hymn and Tune Book</i> (1851 and 1855); for those
of Rev. W. J. Copeland, see his <i>Hymns for the Week and for the
Seasons</i> (1848). For Mr. A. J. B. Hope&rsquo;s, see his <i>Hymns of
the Church Literally Translated</i> (1844), an attempt to substitute
classic metre for rhyme.</p>
<p>H. A. M. stands for <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, which is
specified where the translation is materially altered by the compilers,
as well as where an original version has been supplied.
H. A. stands for the <i>Hymnarium Anglicanum, or the Ancient
Hymns of the Church of England Translated from the Salisbury Breviary</i> (1844).</p>
<p>Of Dr. A. R. Thompson&rsquo;s hymns several were contributed
<span class="pb" id="Page_448">448</span>
to Dr. Schaff&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christ in Song,&rdquo; but they have not appeared
separately in book form. The same is true of Dr. W. S. McKenzie&rsquo;s,
which have appeared chiefly in the columns of two Boston
weeklies&mdash;<i>The Beacon</i> and <i>The Watchman</i>. We are glad to learn
that they are to be collected. To Mr. Anketell, Dr. Thompson,
Dr. McKenzie, Professor S. Hart, of Hartford, Mr. Stryker and
Mr. C. H. A. Esler, I am indebted for lists of their translations.</p>

<p>This list shows how much of the attention of English translators
has been occupied by the hymns of the Paris Breviary of 1736,
which for the most part are contemporary with the English hymns
of Watts and Doddridge. There are 180 translated hymns taken
from that breviary, and of these there are 536 translations&mdash;the
largest group furnished by any one source. Next comes the
Roman Breviary, chiefly through the labors of Mr. Caswall and
other Roman Catholic translators. Then come the versions of
Ambrosian and other primitive hymns, Prudentius standing next
to Ambrose and his school. Of the mediaeval writers, Adam of
St. Victor would be seen to stand first, if all the versions of Mr.
Wrangham had been catalogued, but this seemed unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="c36">APPENDIX.</h2>
<p>Mr. Duffield had copied for insertion the introduction which
Bernard of Morlaix wrote for his poem, <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i>. It is
here given from the text of 1610. The reader will find little difficulty in
distinguishing <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> in the orthography,
and in recognizing <i>q:</i> as the enclitic <i>que</i>. It will be observed
that the introduction is not written throughout in the Leonine verse of
the poem, but varies into two easier forms of verse.</p>

<h2 id="c38">APPENDIX II.
<br /><span class="small">THE CARMINA BURANA.</span></h2>
<p>The investigations of Grimm, Schmeller, Edelestand du Meril,
Thomas Wright, and H. Hagen, together with the translations of
Mr. J. A. Symonds (&ldquo;Wine, Women, and Song&rdquo;), are familiarizing
us with the fact that Latin verse had other than churchly and
edifying uses in the Middle Ages. One of the most important of
the mediaeval collections in this department is a manuscript of
the thirteenth century, long preserved in the monastery of Brauburen
Benedictbeure, in Bavaria, but now in M&uuml;nchen. It was
edited by J. Andreas Schmeller, in 1847, at Stuttgardt, and his
edition was reprinted at Breslau, in 1883. From it Mr. Symonds
draws most of his material for his volume of translations.</p>
<p>I find among Mr. Duffield&rsquo;s papers some specimens of these
poems of the Bavarian collection, which I think fitted to illustrate
the literary relations of the Latin hymns, and therefore they are
inserted here.</p>

<h3>THE FOUR CRAZED BROTHERS.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Shrivelled into corpselike thinness</p>
<p class="t">Four within the madhouse sit;</p>
<p class="t0">From their pallid lips no sentence</p>

<p class="t0">Starkly there they face each other,</p>
<p class="t0">Each more gloomy than his brother.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hark! the hour of midnight striking</p>
<p class="t">Lifts their very hair with fright;</p>
<p class="t0">Then at last their lips are open,</p>

<p class="t0"><i>Dies irae, dies illa,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Solvet saeclum in favilla!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Once they were four evil brothers,</p>
<p class="t">Drunk and clamorous withal,</p>
<p class="t0">Who with lewd and ribald ditties</p>
<p class="t">Through the holy night would brawl,</p>
<p class="t0">Heeding not their father&rsquo;s warning,</p>
<p class="t0">Even friend&rsquo;s remonstrance scorning.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Gape their mouths for very horror,</p>

<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s eternal vengeance strikes them,</p>

<p class="t0">White their hair and pale their faces,</p>
<p class="t0">Madness every mind erases!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then the old man, dying, turned him</p>
<p class="t">To his wicked sons, and said:</p>

<p class="t0">Thus they lived and thus they revelled,</p>
<p class="t">Until many a year had fled;</p>
<p class="t0">Others&rsquo; sorrow cost them nothing,</p>
<p class="t">Blanched no hair upon the head;</p>
<p class="t0">Jolly brothers! they were able</p>
<p class="t0">To hold God and sin a fable!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But at last, as midnight found them</p>
<p class="t">Drunkly reeling from the feast,</p>
<p class="t0">Hark! the song of saints was lifted</p>
<p class="t">Through the church, and high increased;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Cease your barking, hounds!&rdquo; they shouted,</p>
<p class="t0">As with Satan&rsquo;s mouth undoubted.</p>

course the champions of papal infallibility are at great pains to
deny this. But all the contemporary writers, such as Athanasius, Hilary,
and Jerome, assert it, and against it there is nothing but <i>a priori</i>
assumptions and the assertion that the third Sirmian formula signed by
Liberius has been mistaken for the first, which was Arian. In Dr. Newman&rsquo;s
<i>Arians of the Fourth Century</i>, pp. 433-40, there is a careful account
of the three Sirmian formulas. The main fact never was denied until
the necessities of the infallibility theory compelled the rewriting of history.
Even the old Roman Breviary declares that &ldquo;Liberius assented to
the Arian mischief.&rdquo;

Ages</i> (New York, 1872), pp. 183-209. In 1582 Gregory XIII. was on
the point of expunging his name from the Roman Martyrology, as Baronius
had proven that he was neither a pope nor a martyr, but had died
peaceably on his own estate near Rome. But the discovery of a stone
with an inscription asserting his martyrdom turned the scale the other
way. Modern scholarship stigmatizes the inscription as a fraud, and it
is notable that the stone has disappeared.

<i>Varia de Corrupto Statu Ecclesiae Poemata</i> was reprinted in 1754,
but even this is very scarce. There was an earlier publication of his of
the same nature, <i>Carmina Vetusta</i> (1548), but whether it contained Bernard,
I cannot say. Flacius was an unwearied searcher of the libraries
of Europe for material to use on the Lutheran side of the great controversy.</div>
<p class="fncont">The poem was then reprinted at least six times: &ldquo;by David Chytraeus
at Bremen, 1597; at Rostock, 1610; at Leipzig, 1626; by Eilhard Lubinus,
at Lunenburg, 1640; in Wachler&rsquo;s <i>New Theological Annals</i>, December,
1820; and in G. Ch. F. Mohnike&rsquo;s <i>Studien</i> (Stralsund, 1824) I., 18.&rdquo;
Yet it had become so scarce that when I made my version of Dr. Trench&rsquo;s
cento, I could not find a complete copy in America. Since then I have
received a copy of the edition of 1640 from a friend. Also the Boston
Public Library has secured a copy of the <i>Varia Poemata</i>, which was once
Theodore Parker&rsquo;s, and bears the inscription, &ldquo;A rare and curious book.
T. P.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fncont">The English translations are: (1) Dr. Trench has rendered a few lines
in the metre of the original. (2) Dr. John M. Neale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhythm of Bernard
of Morlaix&rdquo; (1858). (3) Judge Noyes in the &ldquo;Seven Great Hymns
of the Latin Church.&rdquo; (4) Dr. Abraham Coles. (5) &ldquo;The Heavenly Land,
from the <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i> of Bernard of Morlaix, rendered into corresponding
English Verse,&rdquo; by S. W. Duffield (1867). (6) A privately
printed translation by &ldquo;O. A. M.,&rdquo; of Cherry Valley, N. Y. (Albany,
1867). (7) Gerard Moultrie in <i>Lyra Mystica</i> (1869). (8) Rev. Jackson
Mason (London, 1880). Besides this, an English clergyman has perpetrated
the folly of rendering Dr. Neale&rsquo;s paraphrase into Horatian
Latin verse, which would puzzle Bernard himself to recognize as derived
from him.</p>

of his history, which I have not been able to overcome. Unfortunately this
greatest of Catholic dogmatists never seems to have inspired enough of
personal interest in any disciple or contemporary to lead to the preparation
of a biography of him. So the earliest in existence were written
long after his death, when the Neapolitans asked for his canonization.
And a comparison of their statements with those of contemporary chronicles,
like that of Richard of San Germano, does not inspire confidence in
their veracity.</div>
<p class="fncont">The second papal war broke out in 1239. Both the orders of friars,
Dominicans and Franciscans, were believed to be partisans of the Pope,
and in 1239 such as were not natives of the kingdom were commanded to
leave it. Richard of San Germano mentions this order <i>sub anno</i> 1239,
and adds, <i>sub anno</i> 1240, that by November of the latter year all the Mendicants,
except two of each monastery and those natives of the kingdom,
had been expelled by order of the Emperor. What Dominicans were
there left in Naples to win the affections of Thomas and receive him into
the novitiate? The difficulty would be met by assuming 1225 as the date
of Thomas&rsquo;s birth, and his stay at Monte Casino as terminating with his
tenth year, so that he might have been at Naples in 1235 and formed the
purpose to enter the order in 1239. Or if he went to Naples in his twelfth
year (1237), he might have become a Dominican novice after two years
of study under professors of that order. It is true that novices were not
to be received before their fifteenth year; but at any date after March of
1239 Thomas would be in his fifteenth year. It was March 24th of that
year that saw the Emperor excommunicated, and some interval would
elapse before the expulsion of the Mendicants.</p>

philosophers of the age have borne witness to it for many years. Those
great names in our literature, Sir Walter Scott, Mr. Wordsworth, Mr.
Coleridge, though in different ways, and with essential differences one
from another and perhaps from any Church system, still all bear witness
to it. The system of Mr. Irving is another witness to it. The age is
moving toward something, and, most unhappily, the one religious communion
which has of late years been practically in possession of that
something, is the Church of Rome.&rdquo;

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
